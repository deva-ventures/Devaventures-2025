         <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome Devan, to Global Influencers Hub. 
                Here, we talk about the life journeys of influencers—especially social media influencers—
                and we cannot wait to deep dive into yours. And when I say “deep dive,” I mean all the 
                way back to your childhood. Tell us about Devan as a child.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan Rajkumar:</strong> Thank you, Devika. I’m excited to be here. So, I grew up in Toronto—
                specifically in Richmond Hill, just north of the city. My childhood was filled with a lot of food, honestly. 
                I was always drawn to the kitchen—the sights and sounds, the aromas, the pots banging, the sizzling, the sauteing... 
                food just fascinated me.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan Rajkumar:</strong> I was also a very active kid, into sports and all that, 
                but I’d always rush home after school to see what my mom was cooking. 
                The funny thing is, I never imagined I’d become a chef one day. 
                I didn’t think I’d make a career out of it, but here I am—and I couldn’t be happier.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. So what’s your earliest memory of actually cooking something?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Hmm... I must’ve been five or six years old. I remember sitting on the floor of my 
                grandmother’s apartment—bless her soul, she’s no longer with us. She was using what we call a <em>sil and lorha</em>—
                essentially a grinding stone made up of a large brick and a smaller one used to crush ingredients.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> She was making coconut choka, which is grated coconut that’s dried out—traditionally in the sun, 
                but in Canada, we do it in the oven. Once it’s dry, you mix it with chilli peppers, garlic, mustard oil, seasoning, 
                garam masala, and more. You build this beautiful condiment. That’s one of my oldest and most vivid memories of food and cooking.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so rich in culture. Who in your family would you say influenced your love for food the most?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Definitely my mom—though my grandmother was also a big influence. But yeah, my mom stands out. 
                Although my grandmother appears a lot in my content for that reason because I spent so much time with her. 
                But my mom was very cool. She, coming to Canada, brought her Indo-Guyanese background but was also inspired by the 
                diversity around her—people she met, things she saw on TV, or even just heard about. 
                So we had everything at home—Italian dishes, international flavors, and, of course, traditional Guyanese and South Asian food. 
                My mind was constantly being opened to new tastes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Were you a picky eater as a kid or were you pretty much open to trying new things?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Not picky at all. I mean, sure—I didn’t like olives or licorice growing up. 
                I still don’t love licorice, to be honest! But olives? I’m obsessed with them now.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Even as a kid, I was curious about food. I tried sushi early on, ate offal and sweetbreads—things that many people shy away from. 
                And recently, I even tried tarantulas in Cambodia! I’ve always said, “I’ll try everything atleast once.” 
                That curiosity’s always been in me.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s impressive! Now let’s talk about that pivotal moment. When did you decide to become a chef?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> It was around 2008 or 2009. I had been drifting in and out of universities, 
                taking continuing education classes, but I wasn’t going anywhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> My parents had their own expectations—medicine, engineering, law. 
                I thought it was just a “brown thing,” but the more I traveled and talked to people, I realized it's universal. 
                Parents everywhere want those “secure” careers for their kids.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> My dad was a successful businessman, so I leaned toward business school. 
                I studied accounting, statistics, all that—but I wasn’t passionate about it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Eventually, with encouragement from close friends and family, I enrolled in culinary school in 2009. 
                That’s when everything clicked. I went from learning about standard deviation to mastering mother sauces, 
                internal temperatures of meats, butchery, and plating. It was everything I already loved—I just didn’t realize I could make a career of it. 
                Sixteen years later, I’ve never looked back.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That must’ve been such a shift. What would you say was your biggest break in your culinary journey?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> There were a few, actually. One was when I left the Food Dudes—a huge culinary company in Toronto, 
                still thriving today with restaurants and over a thousand catered events a year. I joined them straight out of culinary school in 2009 and left in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> After I left, an opportunity came up: executive chef for a luxury million dollar showroom that showcased brands like Bosch and Thermador. 
                I didn’t exactly have all the experience they wanted, but I faked it till I made it. I did my homework on the appliances, went in, 
                did a live demo—and they hired me on the spot.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That job was pivotal. It taught me how to speak while cooking, how to keep an audience engaged while delivering key messaging. 
                It shaped my ability to perform live demos, which is a huge part of what I do today.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So that job really trained you to be on camera and in front of people?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Exactly. It was all about multitasking under pressure. I made plenty of mistakes, learned how to troubleshoot on the fly—
                and that’s what prepped me for the next big step: Cityline.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That came directly from the showroom gig. I started on Cityline in March 2014 and ran with it for a full decade until the show wrapped in 2024. 
                It was one of Canada’s biggest daytime TV shows. Even today, people stop me in airports and say, “Hey, I know you from Cityline!”
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> It built my audience, gave me exposure, and taught me the ins and outs of show business—makeup, styling, live cooking, 
                working with an audience, and thinking fast. It really was a game changer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s phenomenal. What’s the best piece of advice you received in those early days?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Oh, I’ll never forget this—Chef Adrian Nyman from the Food Dudes told me something that still stays with me: 
                “Always finish strong.”
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> When I started there, it was tough—long hours, short staff. I spent the first two weeks washing dishes as an intern. 
                One time, I came back from an event and didn’t properly clean and pack my station. Chef Adrian noticed and pulled me aside. 
                That’s when he gave me that advice.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> It applies to everything now. Whether it's a dinner service or a brand event, I make sure the kitchen is spotless, 
                the work is polished, and I leave no trace behind. That mindset—no matter how tired I am—helps me maintain excellence. 
                “Finish strong” has stuck with me for sixteen years.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> You spoke about mistakes earlier, and I want to go back to that. 
                What kind of mistakes did you make in the early years, and how did they shape you? 
                Because I truly believe mistakes are also learning experiences.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> They definitely are. I’ve always encouraged making mistakes—even now. 
                A lot of people are scared to try the recipes I share, whether online or in my cookbook, 
                because they fear messing up. But I always say: mistakes build experience and teach you 
                what not to do next time. There’s really no need to fear failure—it gives you lessons you 
                carry forward. I remember when I first started at Food Dudes, I burned three balsamic glazes in a row...
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That moment taught me patience. Taught me to go low and slow when needed 
                and to be mindful while multitasking. Being a chef is multitasking. When I enter the kitchen, 
                I don’t work linearly. I start with what takes the longest—braising, baking—and fit in the finer 
                prep around that. Efficiency of time is key.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a really grounded insight. Any other memorable mistakes from those early days?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Oh yeah—one that really humbled me. It was around 2013. I was doing a live demo 
                at Luxe Appliance Studio for about eight people... I sliced a chunk right off my thumb. 
                It went through the nail. I immediately said, “I’ll be right back,” and rushed to the back...
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That experience taught me to pay attention, leave the ego at the door, 
                and focus on what really matters. It’s not about showing off or pretending to know everything. 
                Cooking demands humility.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a turning point—something that shifted things for you, internally too.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> It did. I hadn’t thought about these stories in a while, but they definitely shaped me.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s talk about the Mad Love Cookbook. What sparked the idea? Was there a moment 
                where you knew you had to create it?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Honestly, I never imagined Mad Love becoming what it is today... Over the last three to four years, 
                I’ve really stepped into this space of modernizing East and West Indian cuisine. That’s become my signature...
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And the name Mad Love—there’s something so evocative about it. What’s the story behind it?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That one’s special. I came back from traveling in early 2020... After five days, I emerged and filmed 
                my first “Chef Dev at Home” video. I shaved $50 worth of black truffle onto Kraft Dinner mac and cheese. 
                It was theatrical... At the end of those videos, I’d naturally say “mad love.” That’s just me—I say 
                “mad tired,” “mad hungry.”... For me, love is an essential ingredient in food. You can’t write it into 
                a recipe, but it’s the intention behind every dish. If you’re not cooking with love, what are you doing?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> We had to fight with the publisher to get that name on the book. The other suggestions 
                didn’t feel authentic. Now Mad Love is a whole vibe—and I’m looking at a stack of them right now, still blown away.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s almost spiritual. The intent, the energy behind your cooking—it’s so real. 
                It truly speaks through your food.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That’s exactly why no one beats my mom’s cooking. It’s all love.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I get that. I absolutely love the name Mad Love. It’s authentic, it’s powerful—and it fits you perfectly.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Given how much you've traveled and cooked across different cultures, what’s the most surprising thing you’ve learned?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> There’s been a lot, honestly. But one moment that really stuck with me was during my travels in 2016. 
                I was on the road for about six months, cooking in India, Dubai, Peru, Italy, London—pretty much all over. 
                But India... India really blew my mind...
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> In what way?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> I thought I had a good grasp on Indian food. You know, growing up with it, cooking it, eating it. 
                But once I got there, I realized how little I actually knew... That realization—how vast the culinary world really is—
                was humbling and inspiring.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful realization—and I think it applies to every field. 
                The vastness of what we don’t know far outweighs what we do.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Absolutely. And acknowledging that keeps you curious and grounded.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Speaking of curiosity, are there any global culinary trends you’re really excited about right now?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Oh, definitely. I’m really into these fusion mashups that are happening—where different cultures 
                blend together in exciting ways... Like, there’s a recipe in there for palak paneer spanakopita.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing! What’s spanakopita?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> It’s a Greek dish—filo pastry layered with sautéed spinach, herbs, garlic, dill, and lots of feta. 
                In my head, I thought, “This is just spinach and cheese—why not palak paneer inside?”... 
                Another one is lamb vindaloo meatballs... It’s comforting, familiar, but also excitingly different.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so inventive! And this type of fusion really seems to resonate with today’s food culture.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Yeah! You see ramen pasta, sushi burritos, nihari pizzas, butter chicken pizzas... I love it all. As long as it respects the traditions it draws from, I think fusion is a beautiful way to celebrate diversity. At the end of the day, it's about joy—making your tummy happy and bringing people together around food.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that. Now, what’s your approach when creating a menu—especially for large events?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> It really depends. I’ve got a big catering coming up in Guyana—over a few hundred people, with eight appetizers, and two live stations. I don’t cater as much these days, but when I do, it’s all about customization. I call them bespoke events. I like to talk to the client, learn about what they love, any restrictions, their travel experiences—just absorb it all. Then I create a menu that reflects that, weaving in my own experiences, cultural influences, and flavors I grew up with in Toronto.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Growing up in Toronto must have really shaped your palate.</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Massively. It’s a melting pot here. Any day of the week, I can eat a different cuisine—Vietnamese, Ethiopian, Lebanese, Caribbean. That diversity has influenced not just what I eat, but how I cook and think about food. It's been one of the greatest gifts of growing up in this city.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And with all the pressure that comes in kitchens, how do you handle it?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> It’s a lot, no doubt. Especially early on, working with Food Dudes—always understaffed, always racing against the clock. I had to learn to slow myself down over the years. Now, whether I’m in Portugal or Victoria or Guyana, I walk into kitchens with teams I’ve never met, and there’s pressure to deliver. But I lean on experience, communicate clearly, and earn people’s trust.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must be challenging when there are preconceived notions too.</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Oh, absolutely. I remember going to Victoria for an event as part of a book tour. The team there had this idea that I’d be a diva—just another celebrity chef. But we had a call while I was in Jamaica, and once I got there and worked with them, the chef actually told me, “I misjudged you. You’re humble, down-to-earth—it’s been an honor.” That meant the world to me. I don’t like yelling in the kitchen. I let people make mistakes, even twice or three times. After that, I might step in more firmly, but kindness is my default.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really admirable. Now a fun one—what’s your all-time favorite comfort food?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Without a doubt—pizza. Specifically, a New York slice. I go to New York every year just for that. But also? Instant noodles.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, the 90s Maggi nostalgia?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Exactly! Instant noodles got me through tough times—university days, low-budget meals. I still love them. Korean or Japanese ones especially. Just water, no stove or oven needed. And beyond that, bowls of pho, ramen, Korean hot soups like kimchi jjigae or sundubu—those are all super comforting to me.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And your favorite kitchen gadget you can't live without?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> I’m not big on gadgets with only one function—like garlic presses. But the Microplane? That’s a must. I use it for everything—Parmesan, nutmeg, garlic, citrus zest. Also, a good mandoline for thin slicing or julienne cuts. Both are essentials for me.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright. If you could cook for any celebrity or historical figure, who would it be?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Without hesitation—Anthony Bourdain.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Beautiful choice. Is there a playlist you have for your kitchen?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> A playlist? Yeah, definitely. I listen to whatever I’m feeling in the moment—sometimes it's the '80s, sometimes a lot of hip hop. In fact, I have four playlists in my cookbook right at the beginning. You can scan a code, and it takes you directly to Spotify. A lot of my favorite music is there, but honestly, it varies—could be rock and roll, could be Elton John's greatest hits, or the Fugees. You really never know. It depends on my mood. But I always have music playing. Sometimes I have my AirPods in—usually just one, so I can still hear what’s happening in the kitchen.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Just one AirPod?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Yeah, I used to use both, but hearing is incredibly important in the kitchen. You need to hear the sizzling, the bubbling—those subtle sounds help me gauge what’s happening with my food. Like, I can tell how my onions are doing just by the sound—whether it’s a soft sizzle or something more aggressive. I can literally smell when something’s about to burn and hear it even before that. So, yeah, one AirPod in, so I stay connected but still in tune with the kitchen.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very cool. So, what’s next for Chef Dev?</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> A lot! I’m actually leaving tomorrow morning for Halifax, Nova Scotia. In a few weeks, I’ll be in Guyana for a catering project—that’ll be a few weeks too. Then I’m headed to Turkey with Turkish Airlines in May. It’s been non-stop. I’m trying not to travel as much this year because last year I was on the road two to three weeks every month, and it wore me down.</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Right now, we’re focusing on cookbook pop-ups, and I’m working on the second cookbook based in Toronto. I have a meeting about that today, actually.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow, second cookbook! That’s exciting.</p>

              <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Yeah, very! And we have big events coming up. The Toronto Food and Drink Show is soon—it’s the biggest food event here. It’s held at the downtown convention center with hundreds of vendors and thousands of attendees. There’s a chef stage in the middle of all the action, and for the third year in a row, I’ll be headlining on Saturday at 8 PM. Among twenty or so chefs, that slot means a lot to me. Canada’s Restaurant Show is coming too—that’s for industry folks. I’ll be hosting a major competition on stage there. And there are a few other projects in the pipeline I can’t talk about just yet. Not confirmed. But yeah, I’m always doing pop-ups, always collaborating with brands. Things are definitely happening.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Fabulous! So, what has been your life
                mantra?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> My mantra ties back to ego and humility.
                There’s this line I always repeat to myself: True humility is
                not thinking less of yourself, it’s thinking of yourself less.
                That’s what I live by. I even have the word "Seva" tattooed on
                me. It all connects—doing for others without seeking praise or
                recognition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thinking less about myself allows me to think more about others.
                That doesn’t mean I don’t take care of myself—it’s like putting
                your oxygen mask on first. But I really believe I’m here to
                enrich others’ lives. That’s what drives me.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. Have you been on a
                spiritual journey?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Without question. Absolutely. I was
                raised in a Hindu household, going to Mandir regularly. I’m not
                particularly religious today, but all of that shaped me.
                Subconsciously, those values stayed with me.
              </p>
              <p>
                About four years ago, I began a journey of sobriety. That’s when
                I really began to nurture a spiritual connection with a higher
                power. I’ve had countless spiritual experiences since then, and
                yes—I absolutely consider myself a spiritual person today.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That explains the clarity in your
                responses. Your answers come from such a grounded place—it’s
                evident that there’s a deep influence there.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Thank you. That means a lot. It’s all
                part of the journey.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, in your opinion, what makes a great
                chef?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> First, no ego. That’s huge. Leadership
                qualities matter—a chef should be able to lead, delegate,
                problem-solve, and communicate effectively. But more than
                anything, it’s about putting in the time and doing the work.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of young people today see what I do on social media and
                think it all happened overnight. But I’ve been on a long
                journey, and I’m still just getting started. I feel like I’m
                only at 10% of where I want to be. There’s no substitute for
                long hours, grueling days, and years of experience. That’s what
                makes a great chef.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And let’s talk a bit about your social
                media. You’ve built a strong following. How do you engage with
                your audience?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> One thing that surprises people is that
                I respond to every DM. I do have a team—there’s a community
                manager who helps with strategy, captions, scheduling, and
                responding to comments. But when it comes to DMs, I personally
                reply to each one.
              </p>
              <p>
                If someone takes time to message me, I feel it’s only fair I
                take the time to message them back. That connection means a lot
                to me.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So would you like to share a memorable
                fan moment or a special encounter with a follower that really
                stuck with you?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Absolutely. There are a lot of them, and
                I’m incredibly grateful for every one. But I’ll share two that
                really stand out—one local and one international. The local one
                happened at the Toronto Food and Drink Show. I’ve done that
                event for the past few years, and we’ve got a big one coming up
                in April again. Last year, after my live demo on stage—which had
                the biggest crowd, high energy, just amazing—I was doing a
                meet-and-greet and signing copies of my cookbook. There was a
                long line, and this one lady, by the time she reached me, just
                started crying. She was so emotional, so excited. She told me
                she’d been following me for a long time. Tears were literally
                rolling down her face while we took a photo together. I signed
                her apron and her cookbook. That moment really touched me. It
                reminded me that even though I may never meet many of the people
                who follow my journey, I can still deeply impact their lives. It
                inspired me to keep going and work even harder.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a heartfelt story. And the
                one abroad?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> That was in the Netherlands, in a city
                called The Hague. I was checking into my hotel, and while we
                were in the lobby, a lady came up to me and said, “Oh my god,
                you’re Chef Devan!” I was stunned—like, how is someone
                recognizing me here? Then she said, “I saw your mom first, and I
                recognized her… and I figured you couldn’t be too far.” It was
                just surreal—being Canadian and getting recognized in the middle
                of Europe. Jamaica was similar—people were recognizing me
                everywhere. These experiences are humbling and remind me how far
                the reach of what we do can really go.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Now let’s switch it up
                a little with a quick rapid fire?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Let’s do it!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite cuisine to cook?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Indian.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> One word to describe your cooking
                style?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Dynamic.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> A dish that represents your
                personality?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> My personal grilled cheese.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Sweet or savory?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Definitely savory.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> If you weren’t a chef, what would you
                be?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> I think I’d be involved in music—
                probably a DJ.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Guilty pleasure TV show or movie?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Love is Blind! I started watching it
                with a friend and now I’m hooked.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> There’s definitely a love theme going
                on here—Mad Love, Love is Blind…
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> [laughs] There really is!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> If you could have a superpower—any
                power, even a useless one—what would it be?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Flying, without a doubt.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Be invisible for a day or read minds
                for an hour?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Read minds—for sure. That would be
                fascinating.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the last thing you Googled?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> [laughs] I think it was the time in
                Toronto. We were trying to coordinate something.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> If you could swap lives with any
                fictional character for a day?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> Jon Snow from Game of Thrones.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And if your life had a theme song?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> “Your Love” by The Outfield.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course—love again! Now, what’s one
                piece of advice you’d give to the next generation of chefs?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devan:</strong> I get this question a lot, and to me,
                it’s like asking what I’d tell my younger self. The biggest
                piece of advice I can offer is: don’t care so much about what
                people think. I held myself back from taking risks—
                professionally and creatively—because I was scared of being
                judged or rejected. These days, I take a lot more chances. You
                can see that in my content and the choices I make.Not saying take reckless risks, but don’t let fear of judgment stop you from moving forward. In the grand scheme of things, five, ten, fifty years from now, the things we obsess over—like whether a post had the right hashtag—won’t matter. So don’t let those small worries stop you. Be bold.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredibly powerful and inspiring. Finally, could you share a message for Global Influencers Hub?</p>
            <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Of course. It's actually right in my Instagram bio: Work hard and stay humble. That’s my message not just for Global Influencers Hub, but for everyone out there.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And how was your experience with us?</p>
            <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Honestly, I’ve done a lot of podcasts and interviews. Just last week I did another one. But what stood out today was your approach—it brought a balance of thoughtful questions with fun, playful ones. Questions like “Would you rather be invisible or read minds?” really made it enjoyable. It didn’t feel like work—it felt like a genuine conversation with a friend. And I really appreciate that. Thank you.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much, Devan. It was an absolute pleasure speaking with you. Wishing you all the best.</p>
            <p><strong>Devan:</strong> Likewise. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Bye Bye.</p>
