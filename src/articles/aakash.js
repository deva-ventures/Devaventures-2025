          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          From quiet corners of school corridors to the buzzing lights of live gigs, Aakash Barnabas has walked a journey fueled by melody, meaning, and mindfulness. An introvert with a naughty streak, he found his voice not just in music—but through it. Today, he's not only serenading audiences across cities but also connecting souls through social media, heartfelt lyrics, and unplugged moments.
In this deeply personal and inspiring conversation with Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Aakash opens up about discovering confidence in chaos, writing songs from heartbreak, resetting through nature, and the caffeinated calm that powers his creativity. Whether it’s jamming till 4 a.m. or making a stranger cry with a single note, Aakash proves that music is more than a career—it’s a calling.

         <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi Aakash, welcome to Global
                Influencers Hub. Here, we talk about the life journeys of social
                media influencers—and we’re truly excited to explore yours.
                Let’s start from the very beginning. Tell us, what were you like
                as a child?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash Barnabas:</strong> First of all, I’m so happy to
                be here! Talking about my childhood, I’d say I was a mix of shy
                and naughty. In school, I was quite reserved—definitely more on
                the introverted side. I didn’t interact much, kept to myself.
                But the moment I stepped out of school and was with friends or
                family, I completely flipped the script. I became that naughty
                kid always running around, full of energy.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s quite a contrast. So, when
                did music enter the picture? Who or what inspired you?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, the music bug bit me pretty
                early—back in school itself. I used to participate in school
                singing competitions, and I really enjoyed it. But things
                started getting serious in college. That’s when I began
                performing in cultural fests and annual college events. I kept
                participating, and slowly, I began winning. That recognition
                sparked something in me. People started motivating me to take
                music more seriously, to level up, and then came Instagram. I
                started posting videos, got love from viewers and fellow
                artists, and that’s really how this journey took off.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so cool! Were your parents
                supportive when you decided to pursue music more actively?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Always. Even today, they’re my biggest
                cheerleaders. After every show, they call me up asking, “How was
                it? Send us pictures!” And once I do, the pictures go straight
                to their WhatsApp statuses. It’s the cutest thing ever.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so sweet. Isn’t that the best
                feeling?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Absolutely. At the end of the day, what
                really matters is knowing that your parents are happy. That’s
                everything.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Absolutely. So tell me,
                Aakash—when was the moment you realized that music wasn’t just a
                hobby anymore?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash Barnabas:</strong> That moment definitely came in
                college. I had started winning competitions, and then one day, I
                got a call from a café in my hometown, Prayagraj. They said,
                “Can you perform for two hours?” It was their first time
                organizing live music, and honestly, it was mine too—at least
                professionally.
              </p>

              <p>
                That became my first paid event. I was nervous, but I said yes.
                The gig ran for three months, and it went really well. That’s
                when I truly felt—okay, something real can come out of this.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful, man. Would you say that was
                the turning point in your career?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> You know, I feel like every month, every
                year brings a new turning point. There's always something
                fresh—something better than before. So many moments have felt
                like “the” moment. It’s all been part of this continuous growth.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautifully put. So, from
                here... where do you go next?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, I ask myself that too—Where
                to from here? But I have something strong with me: a belief. I
                always feel that today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow
                will be better than today. That mindset keeps me grounded and
                hopeful.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. What a powerful way to look
                at life. Let’s talk about your creative process. What comes to
                you first—lyrics, melody, or mood?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Melody. Always melody.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I relate to that. There’s something
                magical about melody—it stays with you.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. In India, we have such a rich
                culture of vocals and melody. But over time, I feel people have
                stopped listening to just melodies—tunes without lyrics, just
                pure sound. And yet, melody has this unspoken depth... it
                touches your soul in ways words sometimes can't.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now I have to ask—do you
                have a favourite line from a song you’ve written?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Hmm, a favourite line... yes, actually.
                A few years ago, I wrote something while travelling on a train.
                It went like this:
              </p>

              <blockquote className="fst-italic bg-light p-3 rounded">
                <p>
                  "Teri yaadein tod rahi hain, <br />
                  Kuch ashq ye chod rahi hain, <br />
                  Na lauta tu jaane ke baad. <br />
                  Duniya ye mujhse choote, <br />
                  Ab chaahe wo rab bhi roothe, <br />
                  Karta rahun main teri fariyaad."
                </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That’s... honestly so beautiful. It’s heartfelt and poetic. I absolutely love it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Thank you so much. That means a lot.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Truly, it’s stunning work. Now, speaking of creativity, what about creative blocks? Do you experience them?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Oh, all the time. In this field, it’s almost like a weekly visitor! There’s so much chaos around you—noise, pressure, distractions.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I can imagine. It’s quite a challenge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. So when I hit that block, I just disconnect. I travel, go somewhere close to nature. I cut off from everything for a while. That’s the best way I’ve found to reset and recharge.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important insight—knowing how to pull yourself out of a block. It’s not easy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Yes. It’s a crucial part of this journey. Just stepping away helps you come back stronger.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> It really is so important to reset, to refresh your mind. And for you, that reset seems to come from nature and travel, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Yes, absolutely. For me, it’s all about coming back to nature. Detaching from everything. Just being with myself. I’ve started loving that solitude—it’s peaceful, healing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. And when it comes to songwriting—do you find you write better when you’re in love, heartbroken, or going through something else?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Without a doubt—heartbreak. I think heartbreaks are the strongest fuel for songwriting and composing. If you ask around, I’d say 98 or 99% of artists will agree. It just pours out of you.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly. Every hidden emotion—pain, memories, the unsaid—all of it comes to the surface.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Right. It flows directly from the heart. There’s nothing more honest than that.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Now, tell us about your first live performance—outside of your college shows. What was that like?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> My first live performance beyond college was actually in a café in Delhi. At the time, I was training in music at T-Series StageWorks, attending sessions there. One day, I got a call from a café I had visited much earlier. I’d approached them back then, asking if I could perform—and now, they were inviting me back to play. It was a big moment for me. The idea of performing in front of strangers, connecting with them not just through songs but through emotions—that was powerful. I wanted to put my music into their souls, to let them feel what I was feeling. And it happened. It really happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Now tell us—how do you prepare yourself before a live show?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> It starts simple. I have ginger water in the morning, no matter what time the show is. I take a warm jug of water, add ginger, and sip it over an hour. It soothes my throat, but also sets a kind of calm. Before going on stage, I try to compose myself mentally. I center my energy. That’s important.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And how do you do that? What's your grounding process?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> I connect with the Almighty. Just take a moment, breathe, and align myself spiritually.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. Do you meditate regularly?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, no. I’ve tried many times, but I’m not very disciplined when it comes to meditation. The schedule doesn’t always allow it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s totally fine. I think, for you, music is meditation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. Music feels like an alternative form of meditation. It brings me peace.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now, tell us—what’s something truly unforgettable that’s happened on stage?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Oh, there’s this one moment I’ll never forget. About a year ago, I was performing, and there was this girl in the crowd. She asked me to sing “Lag Jaa Gale.” I was trying to avoid that one—it’s such an emotional song, and the vibe wasn’t right at the time. But I gave in. I sang it. And as I did, I saw tears rolling down her cheeks. She felt it deeply. Even though it was a sad moment for her, it was powerful for me too. That shared emotion—that connection—that’s what music is all about.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so moving. That’s your real reward, right? When your voice touches someone’s soul.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Yes. When people connect with your music, that’s the most important thing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Now tell me—if you could collaborate with one artist in the world, who would that be?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> There are many, actually! But of course, the top would be Arijit Singh. That’s a dream for any singer. Then there’s Sonu Nigam Sir, Atif Aslam, and when it comes to international artists, Ed Sheeran. Who wouldn’t want to create magic with him?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> What a stellar dream team! And honestly, you belong right in that league.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. So tell us, what’s a typical day like for you?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> My day usually starts around 8 a.m. First thing—I pick up my guitar. I sit with it for hours, playing melodies, trying to connect with new songs. I scroll through music, explore different genres, and then try singing the ones that actually suit my voice. That’s important—knowing what matches your tone and vibe. Most of the day, honestly, is just me and my guitar. And black coffee! I’m a big fan. So it’s guitar, black coffee, a good book, maybe a web series, and sometimes I head out to explore the city.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. Sounds like you’ve built a world around the things that truly matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. That’s what brings me peace and happiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now tell me—on this journey, is there still a big dream you’re chasing?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Yes, there is. I want to take my music global. I want to travel, perform in different cities, states, countries—and blend my sound with different cultures. Collaborate internationally. That’s the dream.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. So where do you see yourself five years from now?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> I see myself performing somewhere in London, maybe some other foreign location—sharing my music, collaborating with bands. I’m very focused on collaborations these days, so I see a lot of that in my future.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Speaking of collaborations—what’s been your most memorable one so far?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, the best one is yet to come. I feel like naming just one wouldn’t do justice. Every collab brings something new, but I truly believe the most memorable one is still ahead of me.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful way to look at it—with hope and excitement for what’s next.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Yes. Always.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah. True. I totally agree with you. So tell us a bit about your relationship with social media.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> I think social media is the best thing that has happened for artists today. Honestly, about 95% of my work and business comes through platforms like Instagram and Facebook. I post my covers, use a lot of relevant hashtags and keywords—people find me through that. <br />
                And the best part? When I perform at a concert or a college fest and come back, I open my phone and see people following me—connecting with me after the show. That feels so special. It means I didn’t just perform and disappear; the connection stays.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! That’s the beauty of digital platforms. Any particular memory with a fan that stands out?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Oh yes. Just a few weeks ago, I was performing at NIFT Delhi. Mid-show, I paused to sip some water, and my phone buzzed. I had a message from someone in the audience—it said, “Aakash, I’m watching you right now!” <br />
                And the most beautiful part? A few years ago, she had messaged me asking, “When can I hear you live?” I had replied back then: “Very soon.” And that moment actually happened. She pinned that message. It made me so happy—knowing that something I had said, even casually, had stayed with someone until it came true.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. A full-circle moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Truly. It’s moments like that which keep you going.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, I have to ask—do you reply to your DMs? How do you engage with your audience?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> I try to reply to every single person. I believe we’re nothing without the people who support us. Whether it’s a message with advice, a random hello, or even just someone asking how I’m doing—I feel there’s no reason not to reply. <br />
                I really try to be as interactive and grounded as I can. Because if they’re taking time out of their life to connect with me, I owe them the same respect. Music is a shared experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a wonderful and humble approach, Aakash.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Thank you. I just believe in genuine connection. That’s what makes it all real.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic. So tell us about your social media journey. How did it all start? Was it something planned, or did it just happen?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, it just happened. Around seven or eight years ago, I uploaded my first cover. It was the song “O Khuda” from the movie Hero, composed by Amaal Malik. I loved that song deeply. One day I just felt like people should hear it in my voice. So I recorded and uploaded it on Instagram. <br />
                And to my surprise, it boomed. I got a lot of views, a lot of love. That moment made me realise: Okay, maybe this is something. People were accepting me, connecting with my voice. That encouragement pushed me to keep posting.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. And when the numbers start showing, it validates your instincts.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. And it’s not just numbers. It’s the people behind those numbers—someone sitting in another state or even a different country who relates to my voice. That kept me going.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Beautiful. So now you’re active on which platforms?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> I’m on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter—but Instagram is where I’m most active. That’s my space.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s jump into a fun round of rapid fire! Describe your music in three words.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Soulful. Honest. Deeply connecting.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Love it. What’s your go-to comfort food?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aakash:</strong> Street food—Chole Bhature, any day!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Classic! Late-night jam or early morning studio session?
              </p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Late night jam, hands down. One time we started at 11 PM and kept going till 4 AM—no idea how time flew.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the magic of music! Weirdest DM you’ve ever received?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> A few days back, someone invited me to a breakup party. They said, “Can you perform at our house party?” I asked what the occasion was. The girl replied, “My friend just broke up. We’re trying to cheer her up.”</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow! That’s a first!</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Yeah, that was something else!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one song you wish you had written?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> So many! But if I had to pick one—“Aur Ho” from Rockstar, sung by Mohit Chauhan. Actually, every song from Rockstar... and Rock On too. Pure magic.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very good. Yeah, so catchy — these tunes really stick with you, don’t they?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Absolutely, you remember them basically.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If it hadn’t been music, then what path do you think you might have taken?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> That’s a great question, honestly something I should ask myself more often. If not music, I guess I’d be involved in the movie industry—maybe story writing or storytelling. Something connected to movies, really.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s cool.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Yeah.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what’s one lesson music has taught you that perhaps nothing else could?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Don’t force your art. If a song isn’t coming naturally, if it’s not connecting at the moment, I don’t force it. It’s the same with life — if something’s meant to happen, it will, at the right time. You just have to be patient.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. We all know this deep down but often forget its importance. It’s inspiring how you’ve aligned that mindset with your music — that if it’s not happening now, it simply means the timing isn’t right.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Exactly. It’s the same with everything. No point forcing things.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely fantastic. If you could swap lives with one musician for a day — and I think I know your answer — who would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Arijit Singh, for sure. I really admire him; he’s incredibly loyal. And maybe one random day with Ed Sheeran too — I’d love to see how he views his life. He’s a fabulous person.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. So, if you had to describe yourself in one word right now, what would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Energetic.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very good. I like that. Since you mentioned “energetic,” let me ask you — what’s that one song that would make you dance no matter what?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> You’ll laugh if I say this — have you heard “Chaiyya Chaiyya”?</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, absolutely. It’s a great song.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Anywhere I am, if that song’s playing — even if it’s just in a cab — I can’t help but want to dance.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Excellent choice. Now, tell us about a failure you’re secretly grateful for.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Hmm, the failure I’m secretly grateful for… I guess I get a lot of reality checks from people around me — reminders that I need to upgrade myself, that I could do better. That really motivates me. After every show, I feel there’s always something missing, something I need to improve, and I try to make up for it the next time. It’s an ongoing process.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a healthy perspective. What’s one thing you always carry with you?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> A voucher for black coffee.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, nice! A big coffee fan, I see.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> More like a huge caffeine fan — I’m a caffeine addict, really.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Got it. So, how do you define freedom as an artist?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> For me, freedom as an artist means being allowed to explore yourself without the fear of failure or the pressure of success. It’s about experimenting with your music or your genre without worrying about what people might say. True freedom is simply being yourself.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> A moment you’re truly proud of?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash Barnabas:</strong> Moments when I feel I’m in a better place than yesterday. That’s what matters most.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay.</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Seeing my parents happy, the people around me happy, watching me do what I love — that’s truly fulfilling.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Stuck in an elevator with only three songs on loop — what would they be?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> First, definitely “Chaiyya Chaiyya.” Second, “Saadda Haq.”</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Would you dance in the elevator then?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> And the third one… I have to say it’s a song by Diljit. I don’t remember the lyrics exactly, but the tune’s stuck in my head. Yeah, the third is definitely a Diljit song.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Would you like to sing something for us?</p>
              <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Sure! I have my guitar with me, so I can sing something different.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, go ahead!</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> I’ll sing “Tumhi Anna.”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lovely! I really love your voice.</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what legacy do you want to leave behind?</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> I want people to listen to my songs and smile — whether I’m around or not. That’s the legacy I hope for: spreading happiness and smiles through my music.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic. What’s next for you?</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> There are a lot of collaborations and shows coming up, which I’ll be updating on my Instagram. I’m really looking forward to the shows — the venues are fantastic. I think we’ve covered most of it. If there’s anything else, we’ll definitely stay in touch. Would you like to say something about our platform?</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Honestly, it’s a wonderful initiative. I’ve seen a few interviews here, and they’re truly motivating. Just a few days ago, I watched one where someone talked about how tough life can be and how to tackle it. It motivated me, so it can motivate anyone. It’s a great platform you’ve created. Wishing you all the best! Please keep coming back to us. And I hope my music and voice reach everyone through this.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much. All the very best to you too.</p>
            <p><strong>Aakash:</strong> Thank you, ma’am.</p>
