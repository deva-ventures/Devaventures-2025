          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          Narender Singh Yadav, one of India's most inspiring mountaineers with an unshakable spirit and 22 world records to his name, joined Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, for a powerful conversation about his extraordinary life. Known not just for conquering the world's tallest peaks but for weathering storms both on and off the mountain, Narender’s story is one of raw courage and unwavering determination. From discovering mountaineering as a young boy to creating world records and surviving personal and professional setbacks, Narender opened up about the incredible highs and devastating lows that have shaped his journey. Here's a glimpse into their conversation:
          </p>
       
          <p>
            <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome to Global Influencers Hub, Narender. Here we talk about the life journeys of social media influencers. So, we’ll go right into yours. Tell us how it all started from the very beginning—right from childhood. We want to know everything about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> My mountaineering journey began when I was exactly 8 years, 7 months, and 11 days old.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> My first course actually happened by chance. My sister, Santosh Yadav, climbed Mount Everest in 1992 and 1993. Every time she visited home, people around us would say, “Your sister climbed Everest,” and I would just sit there listening. One day, during a program, I heard that again, and that was the moment I thought, “Why shouldn’t I try mountaineering too?” I studied at an Air Force School—my father was in the Indian Army and just retired two years ago. He supported my interest and said, “Okay, I’ll get you into a course.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I was part of the Scouts and Guides, and the first trek I ever went on was to Dhanaulti—this was through school when I was in 2nd or 3rd standard. That was my first experience of trekking. But the real turning point came when I did my first adventure course through the Army Welfare Wing at 8 years, 7 months, and 11 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a 15-day course, but I couldn’t sleep for the first 4 days. I was a kid, in the jungle for the first time. At night, when we heard animal sounds, we used to think they were ghosts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That must’ve been so scary at that age!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> Yes, but on the fourth night, I finally slept—out of sheer exhaustion. That moment marked the real beginning of my career. Something just clicked, and I knew I wanted to do this for the rest of my life. From there, I went on to complete all professional courses from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi—basic, advance, merchant, rescue, and MOI.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014, I was selected for Everest for the first time. But that year, there was an avalanche and the expedition got cancelled. I got another chance in 2015, but that’s when the devastating Nepal earthquake happened, and again, the expedition was cancelled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, in 2016, I got my opportunity and I successfully climbed Mount Everest on May 20.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, what a journey already.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> It didn’t stop there. In 2017, I climbed Mount Kilimanjaro (the highest peak in Africa) and Mount Elbrus (the highest in Europe). I did something unique—I climbed Kilimanjaro from the south and descended from the north. I called it the 2-2-2 Challenge: in 2 weeks, I climbed 2 highest peaks from 2 continents, setting a world record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s just amazing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> In 2018, I climbed Mount Kosciuszko, the highest peak in Australia. During that expedition, I climbed 10 high peaks in 3 days, breaking the previous record by 7 days. That was another world record.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2019, I summited Aconcagua, the highest peak in South America. Then in 2020, I was nominated for the Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award—the highest adventure award given by the Government of India. But that was when the biggest controversy of my life began.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh no. What happened?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> When I climbed Everest in 2016, I suffered from severe frostbite in my leg. All ten toes were affected, and I had to be hospitalized. My expedition leader, Navakumar Phokan from Assam, came to visit me two days later and told me we needed to submit proof to get our Everest certificates. I couldn’t even walk or transfer any files, so I gave him my memory card and said, “Take whatever data you need, then return it to me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Months passed, and even after I recovered, I kept asking him to return my card. But he never did. Back then, in 2015-16, social media wasn’t what it is today, so I didn’t push too hard. But in 2020, when my award nomination was announced, he used the data on my memory card, photoshopped images, twisted the story, and posted on social media, making it look like I had faked my expedition.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s terrible.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> It was devastating. I had no access to my own data, so I couldn’t prove my innocence. As a result, my award was put on hold, and I was banned from mountaineering for 10 years. I took the matter to court and fought for one and a half years. In 2022, the court lifted all bans against me and cleared my name.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That must’ve been such a relief.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> It was. And then, without telling anyone in my family, I went to Nepal again in May 2022. I got a permit to climb Everest once more—this time after the climbing season had already ended. Most climbers had summited by 13th May. On 20th May, I took a helicopter to the base camp. The Director of Tourism in Nepal thought I was insane—“This guy is a psycho,” he said. “There’s no weather window left.” But I told myself, “I died in 2020, this is my rebirth. Let’s see what happens.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I started climbing on the night of 21st May at 1:15 am and reached the summit on 27th May. When I returned to base camp, they told me I had climbed Everest in just 6 days. The world takes 70 days to do it—I did it in 7, without acclimatization. That itself became a world record.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s absolutely unbelievable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> Thank you, ma’am. But the climb came with consequences. My oxygen levels dropped drastically. I started bleeding from my nose and mouth, and I was hospitalized for 7–8 days. At Camp 3, I even stopped breathing for a few seconds. My Sherpa thought I had died and informed my family back home. But no one believed him because they didn’t know I had gone to climb Everest again—they thought it was a prank call. (Laughs)
          </p>
          <p>
            But by God’s grace, I survived. And when I went to the ministry to collect my certificate, they held a press conference—initially to check if my claims were false again. But when I showed them the proof, they were blown away. My story was picked up by the New York Times and made the front page. Almost every newspaper covered it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful comeback.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> It truly felt like a rebirth. When I was still in the hospital, a friend called and congratulated me. I didn’t understand why—because I had already climbed Everest before. But then he told me that Wikipedia had made a page about me. That moment felt surreal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> And all of this happened while you were still recovering?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Narender:</strong> Yes. That period of my life—when the controversy broke out—was the worst. I had rehearsed at Rashtrapati Bhavan for the award ceremony. My parents and elder brother were with me. But when the award was put on hold, the shock led to my father’s kidneys failing. He’s still on dialysis today. My mother went into trauma. It was devastating.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I bounced back. In June 2024, I climbed Denali, the highest peak in North America, in just 76 hours—the fastest climb recorded to date. On 13th December, 2025, I’ll be heading to Antarctica to climb Mount Vinson. I've made 22 world records in mountaineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            And during the time of the controversy, I also ran an ultra-marathon as part of the Nidhi Samarpan Abhiyan for the birthplace of Lord Rama. As a sportsperson, I thought—what can I give? I decided to dedicate my hard work by running across all four corners of that sacred land.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s amazing. How was that experience?
          </p>
          <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> So I ran from Rameshwaram to Ayodhya—a distance of 2,911 kilometers—which I completed in just 47 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s incredible!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> After that, I ran a 53-kilometer stretch toward Delhi, which also became a world record. Then I ran from Jammu & Kashmir, specifically from Punjab to Ayodhya—1,617 kilometers in 31 days. That too became a world record. Every day, I would complete one ultra-marathon nonstop.
        And now, after my upcoming mountaineering expedition on the 13th, I plan to run from Somnath in Gujarat to Ayodhya and then from Parshuram Kund to Ayodhya. That’s just a small part of my journey, ma’am.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> This is absolutely amazing. Now I have to ask—how do you even do all of this? What’s the secret? What does your daily routine look like when preparing for these ultra-marathons or for mountaineering?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> My schedule is very disciplined. Every day, I wake up at 4 a.m. and train in the morning for 3 hours—running and strength exercises. Then again from 5 to 8 p.m., I do another 3 hours of strength training. During the monsoon season, when I can’t train in the mountains, I shift my training to places like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu & Kashmir.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> And what about your food habits?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> I don’t really know the taste of fried food or cold drinks. I eat very simple, almost Japanese-style boiled food. I focus on Indian, traditional “desi” foods—milk, ghee, curd, and lassi. That’s what keeps me strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Tell us about your family’s support. When you first told them you wanted to pursue mountaineering, what was their reaction? And are you doing this professionally now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> Yes ma’am, I’m a professional mountaineer. My father supported me a lot—he was posted in Siachen, so he understood what mountaineering is. My mother is a homemaker and didn’t know much about it, but she always gave me her blessings.
        In the beginning, when you haven’t achieved anything, no one else stands with you. Sponsors come later. But family support—that’s the most important thing at the start.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Absolutely true. Family is everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> And financial support, too, is critical. My father was a soldier in the Indian Army. His salary was ₹200 when he started, and ₹1,200 when I completed my mountaineering course. My mother used to stitch suits for ₹10–20 to help run our household. And from that background, they raised a mountaineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s incredible. Do you have sponsors now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> Yes ma’am. Since 2017, by God’s grace, I’ve been getting sponsors. My first sponsor was Honda Two-Wheelers. Then UNO Minda, followed by M2K and IPL Biologicals. This current expedition is sponsored by Spark Minda. The budget was quite high—₹58.75 lakhs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s amazing. So do you usually secure sponsors before the expedition?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> Yes. Once the expedition is planned, we approach companies with our itinerary and the expected benefits for them. It’s a win-win.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Wonderful. So, which expedition has been the most memorable for you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> Without a doubt, climbing Everest in 2022. That was my comeback—after all the controversies and hardships. That climb gave me my identity back. And now, with my upcoming climb to Mount Vinson, that will also be special because it will complete my 7 Summit challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s so inspiring. Tell us, how did your Instagram journey begin?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> I had two pages earlier that were being managed by someone else, but they were unfortunately lost. This current page—Explore with NSY—was started about a year and a half ago. It got verified in 2022. All my expeditions, I post on that page.
        Earlier, since I was mostly in the mountains, I gave management responsibilities to others, but after those two pages got misplaced, I decided to handle it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Perfect! Taking ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> Yes. And the highest reach the page has achieved is 22 million. I post only about mountaineering—expeditions, rescue operations, and educational videos. I’ve never posted anything useless or promotional just for views.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Do you have a team that helps you now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> I do have a PR team that helps with promotion. But we only promote those who sponsor us. I’ve never promoted anything like gambling or irrelevant games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> What’s been your biggest challenge—not just as a mountaineer but also as a content creator?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> In my field, the biggest challenge is creating videos in extreme weather. When the temperature goes sub-zero, even the best cameras stop working. Just a few months ago, I was shooting in Alaska. My 360 camera, which was supposed to be the most reliable, shut down. But my old GoPro from 2018 still worked—because it’s manual, not automatic. (Laughs)
        In such cold weather, gadgets stop functioning, and there’s no electricity. We rely entirely on solar panels. So, if we miss charging even one day, we lose an entire day’s content—and it affects the whole story. You feel like the journey isn’t complete anymore.
        So that’s the biggest challenge. Everything else, by God’s grace, is going fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Excellent, excellent. So what’s the next big thing? What’s the future of Explore with NSY?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> I’ve already started working on it. I’ve registered a trust called Mission Possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Wow!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> You know, in my journey, I faced a lot of “breakers”—challenges that could have stopped me. There are so many students who dream of becoming mountaineers but don’t have the means. So I’ve started training such kids free of cost. I don’t take a penny. In fact, I even cover their meals.
        Whatever funds I get from sponsorships or leading expeditions, I use a portion of it to help those kids who don’t know where to start, how to go about training, or where to get proper guidance. I do all of that for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s so wonderful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> The bigger vision for Explore with NSY is to showcase parts of India that are still unexplored. We’ve already started filming in such regions. Next, we plan to spend a few days with nomadic communities—understanding their everyday challenges and lifestyle.
        You know, we complain if we don’t get fresh vegetables for one meal, but these people survive with very limited resources. Through our films, we want to show how they live, so others can appreciate resilience and simplicity.
        We’re also planning a show called Real Not Reel. You’ve probably seen shows like Bear Grylls—we’re working on something similar for Indian audiences, launching by July 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> This sounds amazing. So tell me—who has been your biggest influence?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Narender Singh Yadav:</strong> My biggest influence has been my father. And if we’re talking about real heroes—I don’t follow the ones we see on screen. In my journey, I’ve seen the difference between reel and real. On camera, it may look like someone’s jumping off cliffs and walking away unharmed. That’s not reality.
        My true inspiration is the Bhagavad Gita. I read it regularly—it’s taught me the meaning of life. And the person I truly follow is Lord Ram. Even though he was a king, he lived such a grounded, disciplined life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s so powerful.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Narender:</strong> You know, a lot of content is made just for views. I’ve never added spooky background music or drama just to grab attention. Views last for 2–3 days. But real content stays with people. If someone watches our video and gets inspired to pursue mountaineering, that’s a win. But if they see something fake and feel discouraged, that’s a failure on our part. I always tell my team—we’ll earn money, yes, but with complete honesty. Even if we earn a little less, we will not misguide anyone.</p>
          <p>Two years ago, a teacher told me, “Child, it’s okay if you don’t help someone—but never misguide them.” That stuck with me.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Beautifully said. Tell me about one travel experience that changed your perspective on life.</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> That would be my expedition in Chile, when I went to climb Mount Ojos del Salado in 2020—just before COVID. It was extremely cold, and I’m a pure vegetarian. The only vegetarian options there were onions, tomatoes, and some fruits. For 20 days straight, I survived on that. One day, I found bread and carefully made a sandwich with onions and tomatoes. Just as I was about to take a bite, I saw the wrapper—“egg inside.”</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh no!</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> (laughs) So I spent the entire 20 days eating just salad. But that trip taught me so much. I was shooting in Argentina and Chile during that time—and the learning I got from travel… no book, no teacher can offer that.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> After those 20 days, every complaint I had in life just disappeared. Now, even if food has no salt or spice, I say, “Today’s meal is perfect.” (laughs) Another experience was in Yakutsk, Russia—one of the coldest places on Earth. You’ve probably seen those viral videos where boiling water turns into ice when thrown in the air. That’s real. There, even cucumbers and tomatoes freeze instantly. We had to boil water, dip vegetables in it, and eat them like soup. These kinds of experiences have taught me resilience. Now when life throws challenges, I smile and say, “This is nothing.”</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the spirit. You see struggle as part of your journey.</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Yes, ma’am. I’ve actually started enjoying it.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Did you ever feel like giving up? Like, were there moments when you thought, “This is too much”?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Honestly, no. No matter how high the mountain, I prepare with full dedication. I never take any expedition lightly. But yes, there are moments—low oxygen, snowstorms, avalanches—when things get tough. In those moments, I meditate. I focus on the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita—its Shlokas help calm my mind. I remind myself that I’ve come to complete a task, and I’ll face everything that stands between me and that goal.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic. So what’s one piece of advice you’d give to someone who wants to become a mountaineer or travel influencer like you?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> I’d say—whatever field you choose, learn it from the roots. Build a strong foundation. If the base of a house is solid, the house will stand strong. If not, even a small tremor can bring it down. Don’t chase shortcuts. Don’t take the elevator—take the stairs. Lifts can fail if the power goes out. But stairs, no matter how slow, will take you to the top, step by step. Fall in love with your field. For me, mountaineering is both my ishq and my ibaadat—my passion and my prayer.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Truly inspiring. Now tell us—how do you interact with your followers? Is there any memorable incident you can share with us?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> First of all, I’d like to share something that means a lot to me. I got a message from your team, and let me tell you—I've lived through those days too when we used to send messages to people and never received replies. So now, no matter how busy I am, I make sure to check all my message requests. I always think—what if someone genuinely needs my help? So when I saw the message from your team, I replied within hours. Many people find it hard to believe that it's actually me replying, but yes—it’s always me. For me, name and fame come and go; what stays is your connection with people. I don’t see them as followers. They’re my well-wishers—my extended family. And I make it a point to reply to every genuine message so that no one gets misguided or left unheard. They should feel free to reach out, just like they would with family.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful approach. I love your thinking. Now, you’ve done so many trips—if you had the chance to relive just one, which one would it be?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> That would be Mount Denali in Alaska.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, why Denali?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Alaska is quite close to Georgia, and a few years ago, America bought it from Georgia. The temperatures there are extreme. If you really want to test your strength as a mountaineer, Denali is that one peak. During the expedition, I carried a 45 kg backpack and pulled a 55 kg sledge—so I was hauling a total of 107 kg while climbing. It was the toughest expedition of my life. Now, I’m preparing for Mount Vinson in Antarctica, so let’s see how that goes. But Denali had everything—struggles, adventure, survival. And that’s what makes a journey special for me. So yes, if I ever got a chance, I’d definitely relive Denali.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Incredible. So what’s your mantra for travel—or even life?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Just one—always go with full preparation. That’s it.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> But does everything always go according to plan?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Yes, ma’am, because I plan that carefully. For instance, if an expedition is scheduled for 15 days, I prepare for 20. I carry food for those extra days. Because in mountains, anything can happen—snowstorms, unpredictable weather. So I like to be prepared to avoid panic or unwanted situations. Those extra days can make all the difference.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Makes total sense. Now, if you weren’t a mountaineer and content creator, what would you be doing?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> I would’ve been an army officer. I actually cleared the NDA exam and the interview as well.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Okay, let’s jump into a quick rapid-fire round. One item you never travel without?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Hanuman Chalisa.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh lovely! Window seat or aisle seat?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Whichever I get—I just fall asleep anyway! (laughs)</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) If your life was a movie, what would the title be?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Well, there’s actually a movie in progress based on my life. It’s titled “Badnaamiyon Se Unchaiyon Ka Safar.”</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! That’s such a powerful title.</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> And there’s a documentary called “The Wire” being shot on me. It’ll be released on Netflix and Amazon Prime soon.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing, congratulations! Now tell me—one lesson you’ve learned from your travels or life that you’d never learn in a classroom?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Patience.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely agree. Beaches or mountains? I mean I know your profession is mountaineering, but still—do you sometimes crave the beach life?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Honestly ma’am, I’m in the adventure field—I love everything. Beaches, deserts, mountains. But yes, if I had to choose just one—it would always be the mountains.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. And lastly, one country you’d love to live in forever?</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> India. Always.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Incredible. Thank you so much, Narender. I’d really love to stay in touch. You’ve been amazing and truly inspiring. Wishing you all the best!</p>
          <p><strong>Narender:</strong> Thank you, ma’am. Namaste.</p>
