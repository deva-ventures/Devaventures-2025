              <p>
              In a world that often struggles to embrace individuality, Sohum Deb has learned to dance through its noise with grace, expression, and unapologetic authenticity. A self-taught dancer, a corporate professional, and a passionate creator, Sohum recently joined Devika Majumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, for a deeply moving and spirited conversation.
His journey is not just about choreography—it’s about courage. From navigating societal expectations to finding freedom in movement, Sohum’s story is a beautiful ode to self-expression and the quiet rebellion of following one’s art. With every reel, every expression, and every story he shares, he invites others to own their truth and move fearlessly in a world that rarely understands softness as strength.
In this heartfelt exchange, Sohum opens up about his inspirations, inner battles, and the power of purpose-driven creativity. Here’s a glimpse into a conversation that moves far beyond dance.

              </p>

              <p>
    <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sohum. Welcome to Global Influencer Hub.
    Here, we talk about the live journeys of social media influencers, and we cannot
    wait to deep dive into yours. When we talk about deep diving, it starts from your childhood.
    So tell us—how were you as a child?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum Deb:</strong> Just as normal as any other child would be.
    Always—consciously or unconsciously—I loved to dance. But I come from a Bengali
    family, and I’m from Shillong, Nikkalia. I was born and brought up there. Of
    course, my mom always wanted me to be in any cultural or art field—that’s basic
    in a Bengali family.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Family roots run deep.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yeah. You need to know something other than your studies.
    So that's when she introduced me to singing. She was like, “No, you need to learn this.
    At least other than your job or corporate field, you should be learning something else,
    so that you can earn money, and, you know, you have something with you for your life.”
    So I said, “Okay. Maybe let’s go ahead with it.” And I never say no to things before trying them, of course.
    So I went ahead.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> With singing?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yeah, so I went ahead with learning singing. But somewhere down the lane,
    I always wanted to be a... I didn’t want to be a dancer—I always loved to dance.
    Just the music—every time, even when my father was taking me to school,
    I’d be listening to Bole Chudiyan, and I’d just be grooving to it.
    I’m that kind of person—I love to dance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a vivid memory! Did you have access to formal training back then?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> That’s the thing. In Shillong, we didn’t have much access to Indian classical
    art forms. There was maybe just one class for Bharatanatyam. But, you know, society always had this
    mindset that male people shouldn’t go into Indian classical dance forms, etc. That kind of thinking
    was very much there at that time. Now, of course, it's much more open—much better.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Right now, we’re in a much better space, thankfully.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, yes, much better. A much better space we are all into right now.
    But then, as a child, especially because I come from a very small place, it was just engraved in your
    head—like, okay, maybe we cannot go down that path. And so I never thought of challenging society.
    These kinds of thoughts never came into my head. So I went on with singing. I loved the musicality,
    the rhythm, and everything. I’ve performed in some shows; I’ve even given my visharad exam.
    But somewhere in my heart, I never probably enjoyed it 100%, you know?
    It never felt like me because I knew I wasn’t a very good singer. That was in my head.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> But you kept going?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes. And because there weren’t many male singers back then in my place,
    we would get called for everything. So we used to feel special maybe. But then I realized—it’s just
    because there’s a scarcity, not because I’m good. And I don’t want to do something just because
    there aren’t enough good people. There are so many great artists out there, and they deserve the space.
    We shouldn’t take that space just because we’re getting the attention.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, yes—I learned singing, and I was doing well at it. I’m thankful to my mom now. At the time,
    I didn’t understand, but when I look back, I realize that because of that, I understand musicality
    and rhythm much better now. Even when I lip-sync, I can tell how the singer is expressing each line,
    or where the sur is off. So thankfully, that has helped me a lot in shaping my career in expressions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an incredible perspective. Was dance always in the back of your mind during this time?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, absolutely. I always wanted to be a fashion designer too—but I skipped that because
    my parents wanted me to pursue something that would definitely give me a stable job.
    Fashion designing wasn’t something middle-class families would feel safe about, you know?
  </p>
  <p>
    But my dad was very open. He never said, “No, you can’t do this,” or was overly strict.
    He actually went with me to the fashion designing school. He said, “Okay, you want to try? We’ll go ahead.”
    We went together, we saw the admission fees, and when I saw how huge the amount was—that’s when I skipped it.
    I thought, “Let me just do what they want me to do.” Because they were sponsoring everything,
    and I have responsibilities towards them as well. And I knew—they would never think wrong for me.
    I was very sure about that. So I went ahead with it. But I always knew that I wanted to learn dance at least once
    in my life. Even if it was just for a year—I had to learn it.
  </p>
  <p>
    So when I got my job and came to Hyderabad, I finally had my own money. That’s when I started to learn dance.
    That way, no one could question me. No one could say, “You’re here because of us.”
    I never want it to reach that point—where someone says, “You’re here because of me.” That really bothers me,
    even now. This journey is entirely mine. Anything wrong that happens—I will take responsibility.
    Anything good that happens—I’ll bear the fruit of it. It’s only me. So I should be the one fully accountable for my life.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Sohum, what exactly did you study?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> I studied BBA, actually. Initially, I wanted to pursue BBA with economics.
    But things changed when my mom fell seriously ill. I was in Bangalore at the time,
    but I had to move back to Shillong to be with her. She was going through a tough depression phase
    and really needed me by her side. So, I shifted back and completed my graduation there.
    I finished my BBA over three years. After that, I got a job through college recruitment,
    and I joined HSBC in the payroll department for the US. That’s where I’m working now, in the US department.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful. So, who has been your biggest inspiration?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> The one and only inspiration I can think of is Madhuri Dixit.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Only Madhuri Dixit? Oh, wow.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, honestly. I can’t think of anyone else. I’ve tried learning from different places, but when it comes to expression, I always go back to her videos. She’s my go-to whenever I need inspiration.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. Was there one specific moment when you thought, “Wow, she’s incredible”? When did you realize she was your inspiration?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Of course, we all know how amazing she is as an actress and dancer. But for me, I never consciously thought of becoming a dancer while watching her. I didn’t even consider it at the time. But I do remember when <em>Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani</em> was released. At that point, I was still dancing within a box. I tried classical dance during a Durga Puja event. We had to choose between contemporary or classical, and I chose contemporary. But in my head, classical meant songs like <em>Mere Dholna</em> from <em>Bhool Bhulaiyaa</em>. We didn’t have much access to the internet back then, so I just went with what felt right.
</p>
<p>
  I performed the male vocal version of <em>Mere Dholna</em>, but instead of support, people looked down on me, calling my performance "girlish" and "feminine." That really affected me, and I stopped dancing in public for about six or seven years. Though I still danced every day in my room, I avoided performing in front of others for a long time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been really tough. What made you start dancing again?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> One day, my sister, who lived next door, was hanging out with me, and I just started dancing to <em>Ghagra</em> by Madhuri Dixit, just for fun. She watched me and said, “You know what? You should do this more often.” She challenged me, saying, “Every weekend, perform a Madhuri Dixit song, and I’ll watch you.” So, I started doing that. Every weekend, I would perform a different Madhuri Dixit song just for her.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a great push! How did that help you?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> It really got me interested in dancing again. It was a fun way to ease back into it. And my sister kept encouraging me, telling me, “You’ve been blessed with expressions, and you need to take this seriously.” Her words stuck with me and made me realize that I should channel my energy into dancing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> And after that, did anything change in your dancing journey?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes! After a long time, I watched <em>Devdas</em>. I know it was released in 2002, but I saw it much later. I’m not really a movie person, so it took me a while to get around to watching it. But once I saw Madhuri’s performance in <em>Devdas</em>, I just knew that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It felt like magic. Her expressions, the way she conveyed emotions—it was captivating. That was the moment I realized this was my calling.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> <em>Devdas</em>—what an iconic film. What stood out to you about Madhuri’s performance in <em>Devdas</em>?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> It was the way she expressed emotions. Watching her, I knew this was what I wanted to do. The passion in her eyes, the intensity—it was something I couldn’t ignore. Even now, when I think about it, I remember every little detail, even her eyebrow movements. It was magical, and it still moves me every time I watch her.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so beautiful. So, after watching <em>Devdas</em>, did that lead you to pursue Kathak or classical dance?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, absolutely. By then, we had better access to the internet, and I started searching for Kathak, expressions, and <em>Abhinaya</em>. But back then, the available resources weren’t as helpful as I hoped. Still, Madhuri’s influence was undeniable. Many people ask me, “As a Kathak enthusiast, why do you look up to Madhuri? There are so many better classical dancers out there.” But for me, she was the one who inspired me to take this seriously.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> It’s fascinating how someone from Bollywood had such a profound impact on your classical dance journey.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. She portrayed emotions in such a natural and passionate way. Even today, I can’t help but be drawn to her style. It’s not just the dance; it’s the drama, the expression, the passion in her eyes that left an imprint on me. I can’t forget it. Even now, I remember every little detail, every eyebrow movement. It’s a part of me now.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. It’s clear how deeply she’s influenced you. So, was that the moment you knew dance was your true calling?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, that’s when I knew. I realized that dance, especially Kathak, was something I had inside me. It was part of who I was, and I wanted to develop it further. That’s when I knew I wanted to dedicate my life to it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> Sohum, I can sense the passion you have for dance. But how did you channel that passion into action? What happened next in your journey?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Well, as I mentioned, I was focused on finishing my graduation first. I didn’t want to tell my parents, “Let me go learn dancing.” I tried to pursue it on my own, but I faced a lot of challenges. Back then, I wasn’t the same person I am now. I had short hair, I was very skinny, and I had dark skin. When I approached teachers, many of them focused more on appearance than on talent. Some would pick students based on their looks, complexion, or other superficial traits. This was something I didn’t know still existed, but I experienced it during my school days.
</p>
<p>
  There was one teacher I reached out to—she was teaching male dances at the time—but when I asked if I could join, I was turned away. I was told that male dances weren’t something they taught. Later, I found out that she only accepted students based on their looks, so she could attract more people and create a good image for the school. I had neither the looks nor anything to prove myself at that time.
</p>
<p>
  I wasn’t treated with respect, and that hurt. This happened again when I went back to her later. It was a difficult experience, and it made me decide that I would take control of my own learning. Maybe it was wrong to judge the whole community based on one teacher’s actions, but at that time, I thought, “I’ll do this on my own. I’ll learn dance on my own terms.”
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been really tough, Sohum. So, after that, what did you do next?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Well, after that, I decided to leave Shillong and find a better place to learn. I moved to Hyderabad, and even before I found a place to stay, I looked for a dance school. I was lucky to find one—Akriti Kathak Kendra—and that’s where I started learning. I didn’t know anything about Kathak at that point, not even the basics, but I was determined.
</p>
<p>
  In just six months, something unexpected happened. I performed in an annual dance event, and out of nowhere, people started recognizing me. I still don’t know how it happened. I felt that my performance was awful—I didn’t know the basics, and I didn’t even know the proper technique. But despite that, <em>The Hindu Times</em> quoted me! They didn’t even know my name, but they described me as “the guy with long hair who looked like Shiva.” I still have the article, and even though I thought my dance was terrible, being recognized made me realize something: maybe I was made for dance after all.
</p>
<p>
  That was the moment I decided to channelize my energy more seriously into dance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful moment! But then life had other plans, right? The pandemic happened. How did that change things for you?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, the pandemic hit, and everything changed. I had to leave Hyderabad and return to Shillong, where I stayed for another three years. But honestly, I’m grateful for COVID—not because of all the hardships it brought, but because it gave me time to reflect on myself. I spent a lot of time alone, and it was during this period that I discovered something about myself.
</p>
<p>
  I thought, “If no one is giving me a platform, why not create my own?” I was worried that people would troll me or react negatively to my dancing, but I realized, why not take the risk? So, I started making dance videos.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a bold step! How did you convince yourself to take that leap?
</p>
<>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Honestly, I had a conversation with my mom. I told her, “I’m doing this for myself. I’m not trying to create trouble or bring negativity to the family. If I’m doing something wrong, it will affect me, not anyone else.” I had to convince myself that expressing myself through dance wouldn’t harm anyone. If I danced poorly, people might troll me, but I was okay with that. If I did well, they’d appreciate it. Either way, it wouldn’t harm anyone but me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve always been someone who values society’s opinion. I’m not the type to say, “I don’t care about what anyone thinks.” I care. But I also realized that I had to do this for myself. I had listened to others all my life, and now it was time to do something on my own terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a really healthy mindset, Sohum. So, you went ahead and made your first video. How did people react?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> I was still in my PG in Hyderabad when I made that video. And guess what? When I shared it, I got so much love! Not a single troll. I couldn’t believe it. It was exactly the opposite of what I had feared. I thought people would criticize me, but the response was overwhelmingly positive. That was when I realized—maybe I was right. Maybe people were okay with it. And from there, I decided to keep going.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> So, when you say "it was all in my head," do you think the hesitation to express yourself freely was more internal than external?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, absolutely. It wasn’t just in my head, though. A lot of people now come to me and say, “Sohum, we’re going through something similar. How did you overcome it?” And honestly, I tell them—it’s mostly fear in our own minds. We assume society will reject us, mock us, or not accept our true selves. But the truth is, if you're putting out something beautiful, honest, and pure—even on platforms like Instagram—people will see that.
  </p>
  <p>
    If people are consuming cringe or vulgar content and making it popular, then why can’t something done with integrity be appreciated too? We shouldn't stop ourselves from doing what we love if it's not hurting anyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That's such a powerful point. But it must have taken you some time to get there emotionally?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Oh, yes. It wasn’t always easy. From the outside, it might seem like I had it all figured out, but I’ve had my struggles. There were times when I was scared to post a video. I’d wonder—Will people misunderstand this? Should I only do male vocal songs so I don’t get judged for dancing to female ones?
  </p>
  <p>
    I used to worry that dancing to a female song might make people assume I wanted to be a woman. But that was never the case. I simply love expressing stories—whether they're feminine or masculine. And yes, I do have a certain effeminate grace in me, which makes me connect more naturally to certain songs. If I tried to portray someone like Shiva, people might not accept it because they have a fixed image in their minds of how Shiva should look and move. But Krishna? People can relate more easily. So I leaned into that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That's a beautiful way to approach expression—by seeing where your strengths lie and building from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. So I kept experimenting, especially during COVID. I was stuck at home in Shillong, but that time became a blessing. I was working my day job, but every week without fail, I’d post a video on Instagram. I was consistent—not because I wanted to be a content creator or influencer. In fact, I didn’t even know those terms existed back then.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> So consistency became your superpower?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, 100%. Once I commit to something, I stick with it. Whether it's dance or anything else in life. And honestly, COVID gave me the time to truly commit. That’s when Instagram really started shaping my journey.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> So Instagram became your stage?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes. No one hands you a stage in this country, especially in a space as competitive as dance. India is overflowing with talent. Every street in Kolkata or Chennai probably has kids who dance beautifully. No one's going to come and say, "Here’s your platform." You have to create it for yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that’s what Instagram allowed me to do. I was very conscious about what I posted. I told myself—I'll only share respectful, graceful content. There’s already enough noise on social media, so I didn't want to add to that.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Did you ever try content outside dance?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, during COVID, when some of my dance videos weren’t getting much traction, I experimented with comedy videos. I thought maybe people would relate more to that side of me. But then a friend said, “Sohum, you carry such elegance. Comedy doesn't suit your aura.”
  </p>
  <p>
    At first, I was confused. I mean, I’m not always graceful! I’m funny, I fight with friends, I’m mischievous. But I realized what she meant was that people saw a certain essence in me that connected more deeply through dance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> So you leaned back into that space again?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes, and I focused solely on dance and expressions. I didn’t have a big space to shoot, so I started sitting-down choreographies. And to my surprise, those really resonated with people. One friend once told me, “You know, it’s your expressions that keep me watching your videos.” It was said so casually, but it hit me.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are thousands of dancers with better technique than me—better mudras, postures, everything. But expression? That’s where I realized I could stand out. That was my strength. So I decided to channel it fully.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible, Sohum. To find your unique voice in such a crowded space—and to stick to it so authentically—is deeply inspiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> So what's your creative process like when you choreograph? Is there a method or routine you follow?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum Deb:</strong> Yes, actually. My creative process is quite unique—and maybe even a little funny! Whenever I'm choreographing or thinking about a song, the ideas flow to me during my commute. Whether I'm on my scooty, in a Rapido, or traveling back home from work or the bazaar, that’s my mental space. That’s when everything just starts to unfold visually in my head.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that's quite fascinating.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Right? And sometimes it even happens when I’m sleeping. Though lately, I’ve stopped listening to music while sleeping—mainly because I already don’t get enough sleep. But while I’m traveling, when I listen to different songs, I start visualizing how the piece should look. That’s where my internal process really kicks in.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> So you start with visualization before the choreography itself?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. Most people think about choreography first, but for me, that’s actually the last step. I visualize the entire scene first—how it should appear, the character, what they’re doing, what they’re wearing, their expressions. I imagine where each shift in emotion will happen, how many characters I want, what they’re doing, and the setting. Only after all that, I begin thinking about the dance steps. It’s like building a photograph in motion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a very top-down approach—it reminds me of how businesses work!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sohum:</strong> (laughs) Yeah! And honestly, that process has worked for me. I did try to switch it up once because I thought maybe I needed to change things. People often say, “Oh, others are doing better,” and those thoughts can creep in. So I tried choreographing first and adding the characterization later—but it just didn’t work. It felt dishonest. I could see it in my eyes when I watched the video.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful insight—there's a lot to be said about sticking with what’s true to your style.
  </p>
  <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Absolutely. I follow a simple mantra: If it's not broken, don't fix it. I’ve seen businesses mess up their best-sellers just because they wanted to change things unnecessarily. You can add to your style, but don’t change what’s already working.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a relatable example. And so true. Artists often feel pressured to constantly reinvent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. And honestly, it can hurt when other artists don’t respect your process. I’ve heard some semi-classical dancers make dismissive comments—not to me directly, but through mutual connections. And I get it, not everyone has to like what I do. But when a fellow artist belittles another, that’s disheartening. You may be a technically better dancer than me, and I’ll gladly accept that, but if you lack the empathy and respect that art demands, then I wouldn’t call you an artist.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Very well said. Now tell me—what’s been the most difficult choreography you've worked on?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> The most difficult one is actually still in the works. I haven't completed it yet because I feel like I haven’t fully captured the character. So that’s upcoming. But so far, the most emotionally challenging piece I’ve done was about a mother who has lost an unborn child. It was personal—my own mother went through that experience. I just sat down one day, turned on the camera, and let it all flow. It only took one take, but the emotion lingered with me for a long time. I kept wondering how my mom would feel watching it. But it was a pure expression, so I went ahead and shared it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredibly moving. Now shifting gears a bit—have you ever had a dance mishap on stage?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Oh, yes! How could I forget? It happened during a Mahabharata performance. I was playing Draupadi, and there was a scene where her sari is being unraveled. I had to take 10 to 15 fast spins—chakras. The stage was dark, smoke everywhere. I fell mid-performance. It was actually choreographed to fall, so that was fine, but when I looked up, I couldn’t see the audience. It was pitch dark. For a second, I panicked—thought they had shut the stage mid-performance! I kept dancing, confused. Only when I turned around did I realize the audience was there—I had just fallen facing the wrong direction!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my god, that must’ve been surreal!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> It was hilarious in hindsight! I was in the middle of a serious act—portraying Draupadi—and in my head, I was like, “What a stupid mistake! Where is everyone?” Overthinking really took over at that point!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) That’s such a memorable story. Now, your Instagram presence is really growing. What’s the secret to engaging your audience?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Honestly, understanding Instagram’s algorithm is a mystery I gave up on long ago. But I have come to understand my audience pretty well. I’ve noticed that when I perform to South Indian songs—Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada—they show a lot of love. Not that other songs don’t, but these communities are incredibly warm. I think they appreciate someone outside their culture taking the time to represent their language and emotions authentically. That support means a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So that challenge of not knowing the language becomes a strength?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Yes! It pushes me to dive deep, understand the meaning, and portray it in a way that even native speakers wouldn’t guess I don’t understand the language. It keeps me sharp. And over time, I’ve also learned what my audience wants. Initially, I just performed what I liked, but now, since more people are watching, I take their feedback seriously. They message me with ideas, stories, or songs. I try to incorporate what I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So you’re really creating with your audience now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. It’s not just about me anymore. Like how Madhuri Dixit’s performance unknowingly changed something in my life—she never knew. Similarly, I’ve come to realize that what I do is impacting people too. When I hear how deeply someone connected to a piece, it makes me feel responsible. I’ve started creating stories based on what people share with me. That emotional exchange is what keeps this real.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. Do you get a lot of DMs and interact with your followers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> I used to reply to almost everyone. Now it’s harder with the volume of messages. I don’t engage with every “hi” or “hello” because it becomes a never-ending loop. But if someone shares something meaningful—like a personal story or a song that means something to them—I try to respond or at least take a screenshot so I can revisit it later. That connection still matters deeply to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Is there a fan moment you'd like to share with us?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Fan moment as in—me being a fan of someone, or someone being a fan of me?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Someone being a fan of you!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Oh! Fan follower—whatever you call them. I’ve had quite a few really lovely moments. You know, when people message me saying, “You’re doing such a good job,” it genuinely touches me. There’s one person in particular—Madhu Banti Banti—we've spoken a lot. She’s someone I truly admire. She’s such a good singer and I absolutely love her voice. That husky quality in female singers—I adore that. We didn’t connect for a long time, but then one day she followed me back, and I got to listen to her music. It made me so happy. Though, honestly, I’m a much bigger fan of her than she is of me!
      </p>
      <p>
        But coming to actual fan moments—two really stand out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Please share both!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> The first one is this 13-year-old girl who created a fan page for me. She’s amazing at editing. One day, I remember, I was just thinking to myself—“Even I deserve some beautifully edited reels, someone out there praising me.” It was literally a dream. And when I woke up—this sounds unreal—but I saw my fan page had been made. I was stunned.
      </p>
      <p>
        I even spoke to her mom. She treats me like her elder brother—calls me “Bhai,” and I call her “Didi.” Once, she said, “Even if I die, I want this fan page to continue with you guys.” Can you imagine? We don’t talk every day, and honestly, I’m not someone who chats too much, even with friends. But there's this constant, quiet presence. It means a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredibly heartwarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> And the second one—there’s this girl from Kerala who saw one of my dance videos, and she completely fell in love with it. So much so that when her nephew was born—the first son in their family—she named him Soham. That was surreal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> It really is. I’ve saved that moment in my gallery. I don’t post about it because it feels so personal. But I’m sharing it here because it’s so special to me. On my birthday, she even fed people in an old-age home in my name—just to celebrate my birthday. She didn’t even know me back then. We hadn't interacted much. When things like this happen, I realize—this is what makes it all worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. The love is so genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly! It’s not just “I love you” messages. It’s the depth, the intensity behind those actions. How can I not feel connected to them? Even if I can’t always reply or follow back—maybe I’m caught up with something—they’re still there. That presence is always felt. I just want to tell them—I know you’re there, and I cherish that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not someone who constantly expresses things. For me, love and connection can also be unspoken. There’s a kind of quiet transparency I value in relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. Now, do you feel any pressure when it comes to constantly creating content?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Definitely. When you’re in the public eye, a lot of responsibility comes with it. There are times when I want to do something just for myself, but then I hold back. I wonder—is this the right time? For example, wearing a saree. I never used to wear one. I didn’t know how to wear it, and never imagined myself wearing it publicly. But this year, I started experimenting. It was a challenge. I wondered—how will my parents react? My friends?
      </p>
      <p>
        But in my mind, it was never about me—it was about the character. If a character wants to wear a saree, I’ll wear one. But I was conscious—will people misinterpret this?
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a lot of overthinking involved. But once I decide that something is going on Instagram, I stop second-guessing. A lot of thought goes in before posting, so once it's out—I move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a healthy approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> It has to be, otherwise the pressure gets too much. There’s always that question—will this get views? Will people like it? What will other dancers think? Is it copied?
        It’s exhausting. I had to put all those doubts in a mental box and shut it. I can’t create like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Art is pure. I can’t make every step a calculated move just to please others. That would make it robotic. I post what comes to me instinctively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And that’s exactly why your content feels so authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> That’s kind of you to say. I tell my students this all the time—even the smallest bit of self-consciousness shows in your eyes. If you’re doing something for the camera, you either have to be a brilliant actor or completely authentic. There’s no in-between.
      </p>
      <p>
        On stage, you can hide a few things—it’s all larger-than-life and you're at a distance. But the camera? It sees everything. Especially your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Now tell me—what’s one of the biggest misconceptions people have about dancers on social media?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> That it’s easy. It’s not. It takes a lot of time, effort, and money—and you don’t get paid for most of it.Instagram doesn’t pay you a penny for reels. Unless brands reach out, or you’re doing a song promotion, there’s no income from it. But there are costs—set design, costumes, makeup, lighting, tripod, ring lights—everything.But I chose this path, so I’m not complaining. Just saying—this is the reality.
And it’s not just the logistics. There’s the creative side too. You have to constantly come up with new ideas, angles, lighting setups—even when you're not feeling well. You have to post consistently because of the algorithm. You can’t just disappear for three months and come back.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And not to forget—the trolls and judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Exactly. My mom reads the comments even when I don’t. Thankfully, I haven’t gotten much hate—but it’s always a possibility. So yes, it’s far from easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> If you could collaborate with any dancer or artist, who would it be?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Everyone knows the dream—Madhuri Dixit, obviously. But keeping things a bit more grounded, I’d say Sadhvi Majumdar among female dancers. And among male dancers, it would be either Dwarkvayan Chaudhary or Manish Kumar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! Now, what’s your go-to dance song that always gets you moving?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> (Laughs) That’s a tough one! But if I had to describe my dance style in three words, I’d say—Expressions, Elegance, and... can I say the third one?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, go ahead!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> What's the funniest DM you've received?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum Deb:</strong> Funniest DM? Hmm... not really a DM, actually. I would say it was more of a comment. I haven’t really received any funny panic messages from girls or anything like that. But there's one comment that still sticks with me—it was hilarious, really. It’s funny how some random ones just stay in your head!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> If you could dance in any movie or music video, which one would you choose?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> I’d probably go with a music video, especially if it’s a solo shot. That would be amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What dance style or skill are you currently working to master?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> There are a few expressions I'm still trying to get right. Anger, for one—I still don’t know how to nail that convincingly. And then there’s the comedy genre, obsessed or crazy women types, and cunning characters. I’m trying to enact those better. Still a work in progress!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Where do you see yourself in the next five years?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Honestly, I’ve never been someone who plans too far ahead. I live more in the present—maybe the next week or two at most. But in the coming year, I definitely want to connect more with my audience. They've been asking me to come meet them, to make it real and not just be a character on screen. So, I’ll try to do that more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Do you have a dance academy or do you teach?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> No, I don’t have an academy, and I haven’t really thought about teaching professionally. I haven’t learned dance in a formal or technical way, so I feel I can’t take that responsibility. It’s a pure art form and deserves the right approach. I can take ownership of my choreographies, because those are entirely my creations. But when it comes to teaching pure dance, I feel that should be done by someone with technical training. However, I do conduct workshops to share how I express emotions, my creative process—more about my journey than formal teaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one piece of advice you'd like to share with aspiring dancers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Something no one told me, but I discovered on my own—if you’re doing something that’s not wrong, not hurting anyone, not disrespecting your family or surroundings, then go ahead and do it. If it’s a passion gifted by God, channel it. Otherwise, you’re not just disrespecting yourself, but also the gift you've been given.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Perfect. I love that. Let's jump into some rapid fire. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Not ideal, but... watch porn. (laughs)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) Okay! One dance move you can do anytime, anywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> The chakras.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Biggest pet peeve as a dancer?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> When dancers stick their tongue out while dancing. Sorry, but yeah, it annoys me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Would you rather choreograph a Bollywood movie or perform on an international stage?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> International stage, hands down. Representing my country there would mean much more than choreographing a film.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you never leave home without?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> My phone and my earphones.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Dream dance partner?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> As I said before, Sadhima Sundar or Manish Kumarayana.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Guilty pleasure snack—Pani Puri or Vada Pav?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Pani Puri! Oh my god, yes!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Performing solo or in a crew?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Solo.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> If not dance, then what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Well, I'm already working a job. But if I had the choice, I’d love to open my own fashion label—Indian outfits, specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Hidden talent?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> I design all my outfits myself. I’m really into anything creative—dream catchers, bottle painting, DIY stuff. I don’t like to sit idle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> The strangest place you’ve ever filmed a reel?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Top of a mountain in a jungle. It was early morning in Shillong, freezing cold—January or December, I think. Definitely one of the craziest spots.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> One challenge in life that you're proud of overcoming?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> The belief that everyone in society is bad or harsh. I’ve learned that how you present yourself and how you engage with people really shapes their perception. It’s about changing mindsets, not just judging them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Best compliment you’ve ever received?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> That after Madhuri Dixit, I’m the one people turn to for expressions. That meant a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s a small daily habit that keeps you motivated?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Listening to songs. They instantly trigger ideas, characters, or expressions for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite song?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Depends on the mood! It can go from devotional to item numbers. Changes every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What does success mean to you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> The impact I leave behind. It’s not about numbers or fame—it’s about what people take away from knowing me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the legacy you want to leave behind?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Can I take a moment here and go beyond the rapid fire?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely, go ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> So, long back, a respected mentor of mine said that two professions are highly respected in our society—doctors and singers. I thought about that a lot. And yes, it’s true. Most people know who Lata Mangeshkar or Kishore Kumar are, but they might not know Pandit Birju Maharaj or Pandit Durga Lal Ji. That always stayed with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I want to change that. Dance is just as noble, just as valuable. Many artists have dedicated their entire lives to it. There’s pain, passion, and perseverance involved. So if I can contribute to making dance more respected—equally as any other profession—I’ll consider that a legacy worth leaving.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautifully said. And very powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So, what’s next for Sohum?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> I’ve been approached for a lot of exciting opportunities. Some really good ones! But things keep getting in the way—my job, travel constraints, city logistics... something always interferes. So I don't want to say what’s next until it actually happens. I’ve seen things get jinxed when I speak too soon. So for now, let’s wait and see.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes a lot of sense. It’s been such a fun and inspiring conversation, Sohum. Before we wrap, do you have any thoughts you'd like to share about Global Influencers Hub?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> First of all, thank you for reaching out to me. Most people don’t know what goes on behind the scenes of someone’s success. They think it’s just viral videos and instant fame. But no—it’s hard work. And platforms like yours, who take the time to actually listen to these journeys, are doing something truly meaningful. You’re bringing real stories to light, which not many have the patience or sensitivity to do today. I’ve seen some of your videos, and you’re connecting with genuinely talented people. That’s important.
      </p>
      <p>
        I said this in a podcast recently too—Instagram is flooded with noise, with content that doesn’t always uplift. But you’re bringing in art, authenticity, and real people. That says a lot about how responsible and thoughtful your platform is. Please keep doing what you’re doing—it’s so needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much, Sohum. That means a lot. Wishing you all the very best in everything ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sohum:</strong> Thank you, Bye!
