              <p>
              Jayant Sankla, a talented music composer, producer, and singer, recently shared his journey into the world of music in an engaging conversation with DevikaMajumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub. From his early fascination with melodies to his evolution as a music professional, Jayant offers a peek into his childhood, his passion for music, and the struggles he overcame to make his mark. Here’s a glimpse into their conversation.

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Hi Jayant, welcome to Global Influencers Hub! 
                We love exploring the journeys of social media influencers, and today, 
                we’re excited to dive into yours. Let’s start at the beginning—what were you like as a child? 
                Were you always singing? How did your love for music begin?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Thank you, Devika! It’s great to be here. 
                My love for music started early, and it always felt very natural to me. 
                Interestingly, no one in my family had a musical background, yet I found myself drawn to it. 
                I remember singing all the time and telling everyone about it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Was there a specific influence that sparked your interest, or did it just come from within?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> It happened quite organically. During my childhood, pop music was thriving in India—
                artists like Sonu Nigam and Shaan were everywhere. I remember being captivated by the band 
                “Band of Boys” and their song <em>Meri Neend Udd Gayi Hai, Mera Chain Udd Gaya Hai</em>. 
                I didn’t even understand the lyrics at the time, but I loved singing it! 
                Looking back, it was quite funny for a third-grader to be passionately performing a heartbreak song (laughs).
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> (Laughs) That’s adorable! Was that your first big performance, or was there another moment that gave you early recognition?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> That was actually my first performance. My teachers were quite surprised! 
                Most kids usually sang devotional or traditional songs, but I went straight for Bollywood pop. 
                Back then, with limited exposure, all I had was what I heard on TV.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really cool! Was your family supportive of your musical journey?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> They weren’t actively pushing me towards music, but the biggest support they gave me was never stopping me. 
                They never imposed limitations or discouraged me. Even today, as a music producer and composer, 
                they still don’t fully understand what I do! If someone asks them, they just say, 
                “He does something in music.” (Laughs)
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s actually a huge support—sometimes, just being allowed to pursue your passion without opposition is the best encouragement.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! They didn’t shape my path but gave me the freedom to find it myself. 
                They may not grasp the technicalities of my work, but they’ve always let me explore my passion.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Speaking of technicalities, many people don’t fully understand the difference between a music director, composer, and producer. Could you break it down for us?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Of course! In the West, a music director is typically a conductor who leads a symphony orchestra. 
                In India, however, the term is often used for composers. A music composer creates the melody for a song, 
                while a lyricist writes the lyrics. Traditionally, a music arranger would organize how different instruments play together. 
                Today, this role has evolved into that of a music producer, who uses technology to shape the final sound.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That really clarifies things! When did you realize music was more than just a hobby for you?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> It was around ninth grade when I started taking music more seriously. 
                Initially, I just enjoyed singing, but when I began formal training, my teachers told me I had a real talent. 
                In Indian classical music, there’s a belief that you either have an innate gift, or no amount of training will make you great.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. Music is one of those things that has to come from within—it’s not something you can force.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Absolutely! It’s interesting because, in Bengali and South Indian households, learning music or dance is almost a tradition. 
                Whether or not you pursue it professionally, you grow up with an appreciation for it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> (Laughs) That’s so relatable! In Bengali households, it’s practically a rule—every child must learn some form of music or dance, whether they want to or not. My mom made sure of it!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! Even if they don’t continue with it, most Bengalis have a natural understanding of rhythm and melody just from growing up in that environment.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So when did it click that music could actually become your profession?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> The real turning point was when I composed my first song. 
                Also, there was an event in Delhi called <em>Youth Nexus</em> by Hindustan Times, 
                where college bands got the chance to perform in front of 20,000-25,000 people. 
                I performed my original composition there, and the response was overwhelming. 
                That’s when I knew—this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been such an incredible moment—performing your own composition in front of such a huge crowd!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> It was! At that time, I wasn’t even thinking about how the audience would react. 
                I was just lost in the joy of creating and sharing music. That’s the beauty of it—you’re not performing for validation, 
                you’re doing it because it’s a part of who you are.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Were you nervous before going on stage?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes, I was really nervous before going on stage. In fact, I think I still get nervous even now.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I think a lot of people say that. Even seasoned performers admit they still get nervous before stepping onto the stage.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes, absolutely! There was this one interview where Shah Rukh Khan mentioned asking Amitabh Bachchan if he ever got nervous before going on stage. 
                Amitabh Bachchan responded, “I just check my zippers.” (laughs) So, it happens to everyone! 
                Personally, when I sing, I have this habit of moving around and jumping on stage. 
                So, I always make sure my shoelaces are tied properly because there was this one time I tripped and fell. 
                That was really embarrassing!
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my God! I can imagine!</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes! But once I’m on stage, the nervousness just fades away.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Because you are a performer, right? It’s your space—it feels like home. So, tell me about the struggles you faced. The music industry is known for being tough. Can you share some of your experiences so our audience gets an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Struggle is definitely part of the journey. I think in any industry—whether it’s music, acting, or even a corporate profession—there’s a process. For example, a CA (Chartered Accountant) studies, clears exams, and then gets a job. But in the music industry, it doesn’t work like that. You might think you’re talented because your friends and family say so, and then you move to Mumbai. But if you rely only on that belief without honing your skills, the struggle will be immense. Even those who have trained for years still face challenges. If you enter unprepared, the struggle is on a whole different level.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> So, my advice is to learn, understand your craft, and then step into the industry. Once you’re here, network, meet people, and keep talking about your work. Essentially, you are your own product—you have to keep selling yourself. It’s not just about getting your first break; the real struggle is securing your next project after that. That’s the toughest part.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, the uncertainty of what’s next must be nerve-wracking.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! Because this is a creative industry, you always have aspirations. You’ve admired and followed great musicians, and you dream of reaching that level. But to get there, you have to face many hurdles. Say you land a big project, but then there’s a six-month gap before your next one—how do you keep yourself motivated? If you’re not mentally prepared for these gaps, it can lead to frustration or even depression. (laughs) That’s the real struggle!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. It’s about staying engaged during those tough phases. You do a lot of live shows as well, right? Does that help during those in-between periods?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes, initially, I used to do a lot of live shows, but I struggled to find balance. Many artists manage both, but since I was also into music production, I found myself torn between the two. You know the saying—“If you stand on two boats, you’ll fall.” That’s what happened to me. Eventually, I decided to do fewer live shows and focus more on production. My thought was—if one of my original songs becomes a hit, I can choose the kind of live shows I want to do on my own terms. If I can afford that luxury, why not focus on it?</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. Financial stability is always a factor.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Between singing, composing, and performing live—which one would you choose and why?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> I want all three! (laughs) But if I had to pick an order, I’d say composing first, then singing, and finally performing live.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) That’s smart! So, do you feel more connected to composing?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Definitely! You know, when I first heard the song Tu Hi Re, I had no idea what a music composer actually did. I just felt something different about the song. But I didn’t know what made it unique. So, I asked my teacher, and he explained that the song was composed by someone, and then the singer brought it to life. That’s when I realized that composers have the real creative control. It fascinated me. At the time, I didn’t even know what A. R. Rahman did—I just knew his music moved me. I started listening to him religiously, and before I knew it, I found myself composing in a style similar to his. Then, I consciously made an effort to distance myself from that because I didn’t want to become a copy—I wanted to develop my own sound.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really wise because many people don’t realize when they start imitating their idols instead of creating their own identity.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! One issue in today’s industry is that since Arijit Singh sings most of the songs, a lot of singers who cover his songs inevitably end up sounding like him—including me! When I post an Arijit cover, people comment, “Oh, you’re trying to sing like Arijit.” But I’m not trying to imitate him; it’s just that his song naturally leads to that style. So, I stopped posting Arijit’s covers—not because I don’t admire him, but because I got tired of those comments. Now, I focus on covering other singers’ songs instead.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fair. Now, tell us about your craziest moment on stage.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Oh, I already mentioned the shoelace incident, right? I fell at a moment when I was supposed to hit a high note. By the time I would have gotten up, I’d have missed the note, so I just lay on the ground and sang it while lying down! (laughs)</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) That’s brilliant!</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Yeah, because the way the audience looks at you in those moments—if you mess up, it can be really embarrassing.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And what about your most memorable performance?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Honestly, every single moment on stage is memorable for me. But my last performance stands out because I forgot the lyrics! Usually, when that happens, I just improvise—maybe an alap or a sargam—to make it look intentional.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the advantage of being a composer! You can just weave something together seamlessly.</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! Improvisation saves me every time.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s talk about your fans. The music industry creates huge followings. Do you have any memorable fan encounters?</p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> When I started posting content on Instagram, I didn’t realize how far it was reaching or how much of an impact it was making. A few months ago, I went for an audition, and a guy from a small village in Maharashtra suddenly came up to me and touched my feet. I was completely shocked! I mean, I’m not a guru—I’m just a guy trying to make it in the industry.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that must have been overwhelming!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes! He told me he watches my reels to
                learn music because he doesn’t have access to proper training.
                His village is 50 km from the city, so he can’t attend classes,
                but thanks to the internet, he learns from my content. He even
                sang a sargam I had composed. I was so moved. If he had spoken
                for five more minutes, I would have definitely teared up.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! The power of social
                media is truly amazing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes, and the best part? We were both
                there for the same audition. I told him, “We are equals. We’re
                both learning. You learn from me, I learn from others—that’s how
                it works.” But honestly, I never expected something like that to
                happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly a beautiful moment! So
                now, talk to us about your social media. It’s buzzing! How did
                that journey begin?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Initially, I had around 10,000
                followers on Instagram, and that’s where I started creating
                content. I wasn’t posting on YouTube at the time—I do now—but
                Instagram was working well for me. Back then, I only posted
                whenever I had a new project coming up, something about to be
                released, or if I was working on something significant. If I was
                casually rhyming to a song, I’d share that too, but there was no
                consistency. Then, my friends encouraged me to be more
                consistent. That’s when I realized the power of regular posting.
                I also came to understand that there are many singers better
                than me, and I didn’t want to imitate anyone—like, say, Arijit
                Singh. To sing like him, I’d need extensive training, so I asked
                myself, ‘What unique value can I provide to my audience?’ That’s
                when I began analyzing songs, breaking them down, and sharing my
                insights. I’d explain what I had discovered in a particular song
                by Arijit, for example, and if my audience found it useful, they
                could take note of it. Since I am a trained musician and
                composer, I understand the technicalities of songs. I may not
                always replicate them exactly, but I can dissect their structure
                and share that knowledge. When I started doing this, I saw my
                follower count steadily rise.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic! Now, tell us about the kinds
                of messages you receive and how you deal with them. Do you
                interact with your audience regularly?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> I try to reply to everyone, especially
                if their concerns are serious. However, if someone asks a
                question I’ve already addressed in my content, instead of
                responding, I simply send them the reel where I’ve discussed
                that topic. Recently, I started something new on Instagram—I
                told my followers that if they had any queries, they could drop
                them in my Instagram stories, and I’d reply there. After doing
                this for a while, I noticed that most messages I received were
                about lyrics. Many people wanted to write lyrics or were already
                writing poetry and shayari. That’s when another idea struck me.
                I posted on my story, saying that if anyone wanted to write
                lyrics, they could send them to me, and I’d turn them into a
                song.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really nice!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> So, I took their lyrics, composed songs
                around them, and even gave them credit in the video itself. When
                people saw their names being credited, they started sharing the
                posts even more.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Do you remember any of the
                songs you created this way? Could you perform something for us
                right now?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Honestly, I don’t remember the exact
                songs because they were random lyrics sent from here and there.
                I just gathered them and created something spontaneous.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Got it, got it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> But if we have a moment, I can look
                them up on Instagram and at least share the lyrics because some
                of them are really interesting. People send the most unexpected
                words, and I find it fascinating.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Definitely!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> For instance, someone sent me ‘Aajmera
                mood off hai’ (Today, my mood is off), so I turned it into,
                ‘Aajmera mood off hai, kyabataunbhai, dukhhaizindagimein’ (Today,
                my mood is off, what can I say, brother? Life is full of
                sorrow). Then, someone sent ‘Parinda, Panipat,’ so I wrote,
                ‘Parinda ban kegayathaPanipat’ (I went to Panipat like a bird).
                Another person wrote ‘Chappal’ (Slippers), and I came up with
                ‘Chappalchorihogayi, lag gayichapat’ (My slippers got stolen, and
                I got slapped). Someone even sent ‘Kajal lipstick,’ so I wrote,
                ‘Kajal lipstick waliladki’ (The girl with kajal and lipstick).
                And then came ‘Ashwagandha,’ which I added to the previous line,
                making it ‘Kajal lipstick waliladkibechgayiAshwagandha’ (The girl
                with kajal and lipstick sold Ashwagandha).
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) Oh wow, that’s really cool!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> (laughs) Yeah, it’s fun!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s talk about your songwriting
                process. Do you wait for inspiration, or how does it work? Do
                emotions like love or heartbreak influence your music?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> In the early days of my career, almost
                40% of my songs were about love. Whenever I performed live, I
                used to introduce my original songs by saying, ‘I have a lot of
                love in my heart, and that’s all I know how to write about.’
                That was my natural inclination—I wasn’t sure if it was a
                privilege or just a phase. Since love was a dominant theme in my
                life, I wrote mostly love songs. Initially, I would wait for
                inspiration, thinking that some profound feeling would strike
                me, and then I’d create something out of it. I remember watching
                Mirza Ghalib on Doordarshan, played by Naseeruddin Shah. I don’t
                know if Mirza Ghalib was actually like that in real life, but
                since GulzarSahab created it, I believe it must be somewhat
                accurate. In the show, Ghalib was always in a poetic
                vibe—whatever happened around him, he would instantly turn it
                into shayari, whether it was about a cup, a plate, or any trivial
                event. I tried adopting that mindset in my initial days. I
                wanted to be in that constant creative zone, writing songs based
                on random experiences. Some turned out great, while others
                didn’t, but that was fine because I was training myself to think
                that way. However, with time and experience, I realized that I
                couldn’t always wait for inspiration. If I kept waiting, I would
                be replaced in no time—there are too many talented contemporaries
                out there. So, I decided to structure my work process. Now, I
                don’t wait for inspiration; instead, I focus on developing my
                vocabulary, understanding tunes and chords, and crafting songs
                accordingly. If I kept waiting for the ‘right vibe’ and a
                director told me, ‘I need a song in a month,’ I couldn’t just
                say, ‘I’m not feeling it, give me more time.’ That mindset would
                cost me work. So, I trained myself to work on command, rather
                than waiting for inspiration to strike.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! That’s a very practical and
                professional approach. Now, was there ever a song where you felt
                you were truly sharing a part of yourself?
              </p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> If I think about it, my first song, <em>TereNaina</em>, which was released by T-Series, comes to mind. That song holds a special place for me. But as a musician, I’ve composed many songs since then—some of them came out of nowhere, like I’d wake up in the middle of the night with a melody in my head. There’s a term for it—‘Aamad’—which means that a thought is gifted to you by the divine. If you capture it and write it down immediately, you win. If you let it slip, it’s lost forever.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a beautiful perspective. So, where do you see yourself evolving in the next five years? What’s next for Jayant Sankla?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> In five years, my goal is to compose music for Bollywood films exclusively. I want to build something of my own—no matter how small, it will be mine. I don’t want to work in someone else’s castle; I want to build my own.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Can you tell us about some of the films you’ve worked on?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> My last release was <em>House of Fives</em>, which is available on Zee5. Then there’s <em>No Waterland</em>, which is on Prime Video. Before that, I worked on a reality show called <em>Lock Up</em>, where I was the music composer. So yeah, these are some of my projects in the music composition space.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Excellent, excellent. If you weren’t a singer, composer, or performer, what do you think you would be doing?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Honestly, I don’t know. A lot of people say they never thought of becoming what they are today, and yet they end up excelling in that very field. But for me, I always envisioned being exactly where I am now.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, sometimes things just unfold in unexpected ways. Like, you might not plan for something, but suddenly you’re in front of a camera, and it just clicks—you realize you’re a natural. And that’s how a journey takes shape.</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Good for them! I wish something like that had happened to me too.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) Yeah, 100%—good for them, really. Now tell me, do you have any pre-performance rituals or lucky charms that you swear by before going on stage or starting a new project?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Yes, I always take God’s name before stepping onto the stage or composing something new. Recently, I was talking to someone about this, and we both found it amusing. I never call out to God like, “Hey Mata, Hey Bhagwan,” before composing. But whenever I create something truly special, I instinctively thank Saraswati Maa. Then I wonder, “Am I being selfish? Why do I remember God only when something great happens?”</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> You know, it’s because you have that creativity within you, and when something remarkable emerges, you naturally feel grateful. It’s your way of acknowledging that things are going in the right direction.</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly. But right before a performance, my only prayer is, “God, please don’t let me forget the lyrics!” (laughs) I mean, I can manage the tune on my own, but if I get distracted mid-song and forget the next line, that’s trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) I can totally see that! But I feel like you have an advantage as a composer—you can improvise on the spot, add something new, and just go with the flow. And these days, audiences really appreciate creativity, which is great.</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Yeah, absolutely.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So tell me, what’s your dream collaboration?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> That would be singing alongside A.R. Rahman sir. That would be incredible.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, of course! And is there a dream venue where you’d love to perform?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Not really. I believe that no matter where you perform, the emotions of the audience remain the same. Whether it’s Dubai, Darbhanga, or Bihar, the connection with the audience is what truly matters. Maybe if I start thinking from a business perspective—about large-scale shows and logistics—I might consider specific venues. But as an artist, the energy of the audience is what matters most.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Completely agreed, absolutely. Now, if we took a peek at your playlist right now, would we find any surprises? A song or an artist that people wouldn’t expect?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Hmm… not really. I mostly listen to Indian music—regional languages and everything in between. There’s nothing particularly surprising about it.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> No? Nothing unexpected?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Nope, because I don’t believe in dismissing any kind of music. I think it’s a sin to say, “Oh, this music isn’t good.” Who am I to decide that? As a creator, I can’t say someone else’s work isn’t good. If someone critiques my music, I have to accept that. But I would never dismiss another artist’s work because I may not fully understand their creative process. Music is vast—Tamil, Bengali, Telugu—so many different forms exist.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> True, true! Now, let’s talk about social media. You’re consistent with your content, and you actually put thought into what you post. How do you balance that with your music career? What’s the secret sauce?</p>

<p><strong>Jayant:</strong> I make sure to post at least twice a week on Instagram. Although, for the past 10–15 days, I haven’t really planned my posts. When that happens, I just sing and upload whatever I feel like. Otherwise, I try to stay updated with what’s happening in the music industry—new releases, trends—and I share my insights because my audience is here to learn something.</p>

<p>For example, when Sunidhi Chauhan’s new song <em>Aankh</em> came out, I felt it was my responsibility to highlight how she brought a fully choreographed performance to the Indian music scene. Globally, artists like Michael Jackson, Taylor Swift, and Bruno Mars have always incorporated choreographed performances, but in India, that wasn’t as common. Now, if a young girl in a remote village watches Sunidhi Chauhan and gets inspired to perform with choreography, why shouldn’t she? Why should singers just stand in one place? So, I try to bring these discussions to my audience at least once or twice a week.</p>


<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. It’s one thing to share music, but when you add a message to it, you genuinely impact people’s lives. That’s the real power of influence.</p>
<p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Exactly! And it comes from the heart.
                When I started, no one told me what to do or which path to
                take—I figured it out through trial and error. If my journey or
                lessons can help someone else, why not share them? What’s the
                point of keeping all this knowledge to myself?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true! Now, if we were to follow you
                for a day, what would your routine look like? More music? More
                content creation? Tell us.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> If you spent a day with me, you’d have
                to listen to music all day long! (laughs) My morning starts with
                an hour to an hour-and-a-half of riyaz. Then I compose, and
                sometimes I just sit idly—people might wonder what I’m doing,
                but trust me, there’s always something going on in my head.
                Scripting for my content happens during my walks. I take one in
                the morning and another in the evening. That’s when I think,
                observe people, and note things down. After all, I create
                content and music for the audience, so I need to understand
                their perspectives. What are their struggles? What are they
                thinking?
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, remember the song <em>Badobadi</em>? It went viral
                because it was catchy and entertaining. I was hanging out with
                my artist friends, and they were frustrated, saying, “We work so
                hard, but this is what goes viral?” And honestly, I felt the
                same. If I’m putting in effort and not getting the same
                recognition, it makes you think. But at the same time, I
                couldn’t deny that <em>Badobadi</em> was stuck in my head, too!
                (laughs)
              </p>

              <p>
                So I went home and wrote: <br />
                <em>
                  “Ekdopahar soch raha tha, saalon se singing kar raha hun. <br />
                  Artist ka jeevan kitna kathin hai, kaise main isko paar
                  lagaun. <br />
                  Tabhi dekha maine Instagram per, trending mein tha from
                  Pakistan. <br />
                  Sun ke halat tak aa gayi jaan.”
                </em>
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> It’s often said that food and music go
                hand in hand. Is there any comfort food you prefer while
                composing?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> I eat anything! I’m a big-time foodie.
                In fact, I can share an incident that explains where my love for
                food started. There’s a very famous singer from Pakistan,
                Shafqat Amanat Ali Khan Sahab, and one of his iconic songs is{" "}
                <em>“Mora Saiyaan.”</em> I was in a band competition in Delhi,
                and I won. He called me on stage, and at that time, he was
                extremely thin. He told me, “Your high notes aren’t refined,
                child.” I replied, “I think I was just tired.” To that, he said,
                “No, no! Bring some life into you! If you love food, music will
                love you.”
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow, what a saying! That’s lovely!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> Right? I took it to heart. At first, I
                only ate the things I liked, then I started trying everything,
                and eventually, I began to love everything as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> How do you relax after a busy day, or
                is music itself your relaxation?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> I go to the gym. It changes my
                surroundings entirely. When you’re making music, you’re trapped
                in one place. A music producer or composer has a desk job in a
                way—just sitting at a workstation, deeply engrossed. There’s no
                one around, and that can feel isolating. So, I need a change of
                pace, and the gym is perfect for that. I exercise, meet people,
                and then come back refreshed, ready to grind again.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one piece of advice you’d give
                to those pursuing a similar career?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> First and foremost—learn! But while
                learning, don’t isolate yourself. Many people get so absorbed in
                practicing that they spend four to five hours a day just doing
                that. This can lead to a mindset where you start believing, “I’m
                better than others.” Never let that thought enter your head.
                Even if you practice for hours, step out of your room, meet
                people, talk to them, and understand different perspectives.
                Hard work and learning are lifelong processes—don’t think that
                you’ll work intensely for five years and then relax for the rest
                of your life. You will always be in training. Even if you call
                yourself a “trained vocalist,” you’re still constantly learning.
                So, never isolate yourself—make friends and stay happy.

              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> There are many names, but I’ll go with
                A.R. Rahman sir. He talks very little, so I think an elevator
                would be the perfect place since we’d be trapped together!

                <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, I thought so! What’s cooler—
                acoustic music or EDM drops?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jayant:</strong> EDM drops are better, but I don’t enjoy
                EDM music much. Also, I can’t listen to acoustic music for too
                long. That’s why I don’t stick to EDM for long either.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Got it! A fan compliment you received

              </p>
              <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> The audition story I narrated earlier—I’ll never forget that.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yup! Reels that make you cringe—lip-syncing or dance trends?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Dance trends look good. Lately, the village dance videos people post—though absurd—I actually like those.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Me too! I really enjoy those.</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> But those overly dramatic lip-sync videos with little kids—that creeps me out a bit.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (Laughs) Auto-tune—a boon or a bane?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> A bane! In earlier times, recordings weren’t done in 440 Hz. Live performances had natural frequency variations, so auto-tune wasn’t needed. Now, everything is produced electronically, so auto-tune is essential to some extent. It’s used in almost every song.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting! Now, Bollywood or independent music?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Bollywood.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the most overrated trend on social media?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> I have no idea what’s trending on social media.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fine! What’s your guilty pleasure song—the one you secretly love?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> I guess “BadoBadi” again.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay! Morning person or night owl?</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> I can do anything.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, Jayant, we’ve covered almost everything. It was lovely talking to you!</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> Same here, Devika.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> All the best for your future! Take care.</p>
            <p><strong>Jayant:</strong> You too! Thank you.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you! Bye.</p>
