          <p>
            <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Ragendu! This is Devika,
            co-founder of Global Influencers Hub. We’re thrilled to have you
            here. This platform is all about exploring the journeys of social
            media influencers—how they started, how their paths evolved, and the
            lessons they’ve learned along the way. We can't wait to dive into
            your story!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu K R:</strong> Thank you! I’m happy to be here.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s get right into it! We’ll rewind the
            clock and start at the very beginning—your childhood. What was it
            like growing up? What kind of child were you? Mischievous,
            responsible, or somewhere in between?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> That’s an interesting question! Well, I’m
            an only child, so I had to play both roles—being mischievous at
            times and responsible when needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a unique dynamic! I love that
            balance. Tell us more about how that shaped you growing up.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Sure! From the age of around six, both my
            parents were working, so I was often home alone. That meant I had to
            be responsible for myself—taking care of things, making sure I
            didn’t open the door for strangers, and handling small tasks on my
            own.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wow. That must have made you
            independent at a very young age!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, definitely. But at the same time, I
            was quite mischievous! The entire neighbourhood knew my parents
            because of me. They would say, "Oh, you’re Ragendu’s parents!"
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! I love that.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, it was quite something!
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> I’m sure it was a proud moment for your
            parents as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Definitely! Parents love that recognition.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! I completely understand. I love
            being referred to as my son’s mom. His name is Ronobir, and whenever
            someone says, "Oh, she’s Ronobir’s mom," I feel like it’s a badge of
            honor. Honestly, I think motherhood made me realize that it’s
            probably the best qualification I have! Although, I’m not sure my
            son would be too thrilled about that—he’d probably ask, "Why are you
            talking about me right now?"
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Haha! He might not get it now, but one
            day, he definitely will.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Now, growing up, what did you
            want to be when you got older?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> I always wanted to be a teacher. From the
            very beginning, that was my dream. Even while earning my degree, I
            thought I would become a lecturer or a teacher. I always envisioned
            myself in the teaching field, but somehow, circumstances led me into
            the corporate world instead. However, I eventually got the chance to
            leave corporate life and follow my passion. Today, I am a teacher,
            and I truly feel like I have fulfilled my childhood dream.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic! Now, tell us about your
            corporate journey. How did that happen?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> I worked for eight years at ANZ Bank in
            the quality assurance department. I was part of the New Zealand
            team. Everything happened so quickly—I received an interview call,
            attended the rounds, cleared them all, and was selected. But at that
            point, I was torn between pursuing my teaching career or stepping
            into the corporate world. You know how it is at that age—you just go
            with the flow. So I decided to take the corporate route.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> But after having my first child, I started
            feeling that strong pull back toward my passion. I wanted to be
            around children, to work with them. That passion kept growing, and
            after my second child was born, I knew it was time. I pursued my
            teaching certification, took the leap, and finally entered the
            teaching field.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! Such an inspiring
            journey. Now, let’s talk about your experience as a parent—how did
            that journey begin?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, it all started because of my elder
            one. Initially, I just wanted to post a few pictures—it was just
            another platform, like Facebook, where I could share moments without
            any expectations. But then, I started noticing influencers using the
            platform to share informative content, and I found it fascinating.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> About six years ago, I started randomly
            posting content. Over time, I began sharing parenting insights and
            recipes. Back then, there were no reels, only photos, but I saw that
            people resonated with my content. That motivated me to continue.
            However, at one point, I felt like my page wasn’t growing, so I
            decided to take a break.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> During this break, I focused on my phonics
            training, conducting online classes for children. But my heart was
            still attached to my page—Parenting Trail. It felt like my baby, and
            I longed to go back to it. I took a break of about a year and a half
            and even started another page under a different name, Parenting
            Trade. But eventually, I realized I truly wanted to revive my
            original page.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> So, I left the new one and returned to
            Parenting Trail, reigniting my passion for content creation. I
            started sharing content again—this time, focusing on phonics,
            parenting, and everything I loved. And that’s how the journey of
            Parenting Trail truly began.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Now, was there a specific moment
            that made you realize Parenting Trail was truly your path?
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, definitely! I had been posting a lot
            about parenting, education, phonics, and topics related to children.
            Then one day, completely out of the blue, I decided to sing a song
            with my son. I didn’t think much of it—I just posted it.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> And then, it blew up! I was shocked. I
            always thought no one would want to hear me sing—I wasn’t confident
            in my voice at all! But despite my doubts, I had posted it at an
            unusual time—around 3 PM in the afternoon instead of my usual
            nighttime slot. Normally, I posted at night when parents were
            winding down and more likely to check their phones. But this time, I
            just went ahead and shared it in the afternoon.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Ragendu:</strong> And that reel reached millions and
            millions of accounts. It was incredible to see how many people
            engaged with it! But what touched me the most was a message I
            received from a grandmother. She told me, "I love your rhymes. I’m
            learning them from you so I can teach my grandchild." That was such
            a beautiful and fulfilling moment for me.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! What a heartwarming experience! Now, was that the first-ever video you made with your son, or had there been others before?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh no, that wasn’t the first one.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, I see! That’s wonderful. So, you’ve been posting videos featuring your son for some time now, and you’ve also joined him in those videos. That’s amazing!</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, exactly.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! Now, what is that one thing that parenting has taught you that completely surprised you?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, it’s how much love can multiply. You know, your heart has space for so much love—so much more than you ever thought possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, yeah, that’s so true. It’s incredible how much a parent’s heart can expand. And it’s surprising, right? You realize you’d go to any length for your child without even thinking twice about it.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! It’s something that truly catches you off guard.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. I completely agree with you. The depth of love and selflessness that comes with being a parent is beyond words.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> And I’d say that extends beyond just my child. As a teacher, I’ve found that my heart has room for so many children. Every student I teach feels like my own, and that’s something truly special.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so beautiful, and it really speaks to the kind of person you are. Parenthood doesn’t just redefine personal love—it enhances your capacity to care for others beyond your immediate family.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, of course. The way you look at them, the way you treat them—it’s just the same, isn’t it?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> True. Of course.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How has being a parent shaped you as a person? Have there been any unexpected lessons along the way?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Time flies by so quickly. That’s one thing I’ve learned. They were so tiny—it feels like they were just born yesterday. And now, they’re running around, full of energy. It’s a constant reminder to savor every moment, to be present.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. Very true.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, tell us something that we don’t know about you.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Okay! I am a classical dancer. I’ve learned Bharatanatyam for eighteen years.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow! That’s incredible.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes! I also do contemporary dance and have performed on stage in various shows.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Tell us more about that.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> So, I’ve learned Bharatanatyam for about eighteen years, and I still dance here and there, though not as much as before. But I’m planning to restart my dancing passion as well. I’m always dancing around the house—you can find me swaying to music anywhere I go!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s wonderful! The rhythm must just flow through you.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes! The moment I hear a beat, the impulse kicks in. I always have that fun, expressive vibe.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that! And do you still find yourself doing Bharatanatyam moves subconsciously?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, absolutely! Automatically, my hands fall into Bharatanatyam mudras when I’m just standing. People often ask, “Why are you standing like that?” It’s just natural for me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! And what does your child think about all this dancing?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, they just laugh at me! They’re like, “There goes Dad again.”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, I can imagine! Kids always find their parents’ quirks so amusing.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! But you know, for them, it’s just normal now.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And when they see you dance, do they ever wonder, “What is Mom doing here?”</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh yes, definitely! They look at me like, “What’s going on?”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so funny! Parenting is a roller coaster, isn’t it? What has been your biggest “oops” moment as a parent?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Honestly, I wouldn’t say I’ve had any major oops moments—at least not yet! Touch wood. But I’m sure there are plenty ahead.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great to hear! But honestly, parenting doesn’t come with a manual, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! There’s no instruction book. Each one of us has our own unique style of parenting, and even if there were a guide, I don’t think we could all follow it exactly.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true! Every parent finds their own way. Now, if your parenting style had a theme song, what would it be and why?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, that’s a tricky one! I’d love to pick a song that makes people think, “What could it be? What’s the reason behind it?”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds intriguing! Do you enjoy making your children think deeply?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely! I love planting questions in their minds, especially my elder one, since he’s now at an age where he understands logic and reasoning. I ask him random questions like, “Where do you think the stars go?” just to get him thinking. I love making kids explore beyond the obvious and think outside the box.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Because you're a teacher, you know? That mindset is ingrained in you—it’s just how you see the world. And that’s exactly what makes this so special.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes! Just yesterday, I was sharing something with my little students. I teach children between the ages of three to six years. With the four- to five-year-olds, I told them, "Do you know trees have years too? Just like you have birthdays!" Of course, it’s not exactly a birthday, but you can still figure out their age.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that must have been fascinating for them!</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely! Their reaction was priceless. They looked at me with wide eyes and said, "Seriously? Trees have ages?" So, I took them outside the school, found a tree stump, and showed them how to count the rings. I explained that each ring represents a year of the tree’s life. They were in awe! That spark in their eyes—it’s moments like these that make teaching so fulfilling.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That’s incredible. It’s those little moments that stick with them, shaping the way they see the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly. It’s about planting the seed of curiosity.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s switch gears a little—parenting. We’re always looking for hacks, right? Those little tricks that help us through the tough moments. So tell me, what’s the one parenting hack you swear by? Something that has saved you in a pinch?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Walk away if you can’t handle the situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s a good one. So simple, but so true!</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> If a tantrum becomes overwhelming—especially in public—or if I find myself not in the right mental space, I walk away. Of course, I make sure someone else can step in, but I remove myself from the moment, take a few minutes to cool down, collect myself, and then return. Because how you react matters. A lot.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a valuable perspective. Sometimes we forget that as parents or caregivers, we’re human too. Taking that step back can make all the difference in how we handle a situation.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a very special insight. Now, kids say the funniest things, don’t they? What’s the most hilarious thing your child has ever said to you?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, my elder one was absolutely baffled by the idea that I had two babies from the same tummy! He couldn’t understand how it was possible. He was like, "First, it was me, then it was my brother—how did you fit both of us in there?" I had to explain to him that it didn’t happen at the same time—he was born first, and then his younger brother came later.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so adorable! Did he accept the explanation?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Well, not immediately! He kept asking, "But how did you make space? How did everything fit?" So I took it as an opportunity to explain how a mother’s body adjusts, how organs shift, and how the skin stretches. He was completely amazed! He had this wide-eyed expression, like, "Wait, really? Everything moves?"</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my gosh, that must have been such a funny moment!</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely! And even later, when I was expecting my second child, he was still trying to wrap his head around it. He even asked, "Mom, does the baby wear a T-shirt inside?" I just couldn’t stop laughing!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That is beyond cute! How old are your kids now?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> My elder one is six, and my younger one is two and a half.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a fun age. Now, here’s an interesting one—if you had to come up with a movie title for your motherhood experience, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Life is Beautiful.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s a wonderful title! There’s actually a beautiful movie with that name. Have you seen it?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, I haven’t watched it! But I was actually referring to a Malayalam movie with the same title. It really resonates with me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s a beautiful film, and it has some great parenting lessons in it. If you get the chance, you should definitely watch it!</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely, I will!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s talk about self-care. Parents often struggle with balancing work, life, and parenting. How do you manage it all?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Prioritization. One thing I strongly believe in is that, till my last breath, the only person I will always be with is myself. I have to live with me. So taking care of myself is essential.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful perspective.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, and that means putting myself first sometimes. Even if it’s something as small as having some ‘me time’ or following a skincare routine—taking care of my body and mind is important. No matter how busy life gets, you have to find that time for yourself and make self-care a priority.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. A well-balanced parent is a better parent.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly. And I believe that proper planning helps. If you plan your day ahead, it makes things easier. I am someone who needs to plan my day right from the moment I wake up. If I don’t, I feel lost!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! A little structure goes a long way.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely. Planning gives me a sense of control and allows me to manage my time efficiently.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right. I think the concept of self-care and motherhood is finally getting the attention it deserves. For instance, my mom wasn’t very familiar with the idea of taking time for herself. It just wasn’t something that was emphasized back then. But now, I feel it’s crucial that we show our kids the importance of self-care—it’s something they need to understand for their own well-being.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely. It’s incredibly important. More than we realize.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right? And children are always watching us, even when it seems like they’re not paying attention. They absorb everything.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! They might be looking somewhere else, but they’re always observing us, picking up on our habits and behaviors.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. So, what’s the best advice you’ve received from other moms and dads on Instagram?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> I’d say the most valuable lesson I’ve learned is to be real. Social media can be a place where people fake perfection, but I admire those who embrace reality. Some parents don’t care if their house is messy—they show it as it is, and I respect that. They’re genuine, and that authenticity is what truly stands out.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Completely agree. Authenticity always shines through.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Always. No doubt about it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever received parenting advice from someone on Instagram? Maybe a message from someone pointing out something you could focus on or improve?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, definitely! I have friends who are speech therapists and occupational therapists. When I had concerns about my elder child’s handwriting, they stepped in with advice. They suggested exercises and techniques to improve his writing, and honestly, it helped a lot. I usually don’t ask for help outright, but when I needed it, they were there.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really great. Sometimes, knowing when to ask for help is just as important as giving it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, what is the most rewarding part of being a social media influencer?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, definitely the messages—the DMs that I get. I told you about the grandma who messaged me, right? I would never have imagined a grandma reaching out to say she loves my rhymes and enjoys watching my videos. She even uses them to teach her grandchild! I get at least one or two messages every day from people saying they enjoy my content, and honestly, that puts a huge smile on my face.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. That must be so fulfilling.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, what do you do when social media starts to feel overwhelming?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> I just step away. I keep social media aside completely—I don’t check posts, stories, or anything. I take time for myself and my children. That’s when I remind myself that beyond social media, life is here, right in front of me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. It’s so important to disconnect sometimes.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, tell me about your children’s reactions. How do they feel about being featured on your page?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> My elder one especially—I completely respect his privacy. If he says he doesn’t want to be in a video, then that’s a no. I don’t push it. The same goes for my younger one. There are times when I make videos alone because he chooses not to participate. When he says no, I accept it. That’s how it works in our home.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. So it’s like, “Okay, Mom gets it. It’s a no.”</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! It’s a no.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So he doesn’t really know that you’re posting it somewhere?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> No, for him, it’s just like looking into a mirror. He dances in front of a mirror, and when I take my camera out, it’s the same thing for him. The only difference is that he presses the record button. That’s it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s sweet. But your elder one knows that you work on Instagram, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, he does. He understands that it’s my job. When I’m editing videos or writing content, he doesn’t disturb me. He knows that I post his videos only if I have his permission. I even show him the video before uploading and ask, “Are you okay with this?” Only if he agrees do I post it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so wonderful. It’s like a team effort.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Definitely!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So how do you come up with content ideas?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> If it’s rhymes, I know quite a few, so I just sing whenever my child is around. But when it comes to parenting content, it often comes from real-life moments. If something happens, I think, “I know this, but do other parents know?” That’s how I come up with ideas.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. Can you give me an example?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> One video I made was about not celebrating birthdays in orphanages. I feel strongly about this—going there, throwing a grand party, and saying, “It’s my child’s birthday!” when some of those children don’t even know their own birthdates—it just doesn’t sit right with me. That’s something I wanted to share with other parents.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful perspective. You know, when we become adults, we often forget to think from a child’s point of view.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! And that’s where the problem lies.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> My goodness, that’s such a valuable lesson. So many people do exactly that without considering how the children feel.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes! Social media often encourages people to show off their charity, but true kindness doesn’t need an audience. Celebrating in front of orphaned children, giving gifts to your own child while they watch—it’s heartbreaking. Some adults who grew up in orphanages have even commented on my video, saying they always felt left out in such moments. It’s not just a one-time event for them. The impact lingers. They think, “What if? What if I had parents? What if I had a birthday celebration?”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an eye-opening realization. And honestly, it’s one of the most important lessons I’ve learned from this conversation. I’m so glad you shared this, and I will make sure this message reaches more people.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Thank you.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, so, let’s talk about how your followers love your content, of course. Now, how do you keep it real amidst this seemingly perfect Instagram world?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Mhmm. That’s something I believe more and more influencers are trying to break away from—this unrealistic, curated perfection. The key is to embrace the reality of everyday life. Your home doesn’t have to be picture-perfect. You don’t have to filter everything to look flawless. Just keep it real, keep it honest. Your content ideas should be original. Of course, there will be similar topics—parenting, tantrums, daily struggles—but what matters is how you bring your unique perspective into it. Authenticity is key. Don’t just take something from somewhere and present it as your own. Instead, be upfront, be yourself. Be the same person in front of the camera as you are behind it. Faking it can only take you so far, and eventually, it becomes exhausting.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. Fakery might work for a while, but eventually, it catches up with you. And honestly, it must be tiring to maintain a persona that isn’t really you.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! It’s not sustainable. At some point, you’ll find yourself struggling to keep up with the facade, and that’s when the burnout sets in. Being authentic isn’t just easier—it’s what truly resonates with people.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s switch gears a bit. Have you ever had a parenting fail that turned into a viral post?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, parenting fails? Absolutely! There have been plenty of moments where things didn’t go as planned, and somehow, those have been the ones that people related to the most. There are so many failures—especially when it comes to handling tantrums. That’s where things tend to go south the most. I try to handle it, I really do. I try to stay calm, take a step back, and compose myself. But, you know, after a long day, when you come back home exhausted and just want to get through the evening, it doesn’t always work out. I won’t lie—I do lose my temper sometimes. And that’s something I recognize as a failure. But I also try to step away, acknowledge it, and work on improving.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever posted about these moments? And how has your audience responded to them?</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh, absolutely. Like I said, tantrums are such a common topic. I’ve even made posts about how to handle them. One thing I’ve particularly focused on is when children, around the ages of one to two-and-a-half years, start hitting. It’s just their impulsive reaction to frustration, and as parents, we have to guide them toward normalcy. It’s a process, and talking about it helps other parents feel less alone. I actually made a post about why children hit. It’s not because they want to hurt anyone—it’s simply a developmental milestone. They’re trying to communicate, but since they don’t yet have the words to express themselves, this becomes their way of conveying emotions.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, of course. That makes perfect sense.</p>
            <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Exactly! And honestly, I’ve been on the receiving end of it multiple times. There was one moment I completely lost it—I forgot everything I knew, and I just reacted. I screamed. And then it hit me—this wasn’t my child’s fault. I needed to take a step back and control my own reactions. That realization led me to share my experience, and that post really resonated with people. It was well received because, at the end of the day, every parent goes through these moments of frustration. Acknowledging them and learning from them is what truly matters.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful. That’s such an important message...</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Right? I knew what was happening, but others might not. That’s why I felt it was important to share.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! That’s a great approach. Now, I remember you mentioning a heartwarming message from a grandmom who reached out. Is there another message from a follower that really touched you?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh yes! Recently, I was honored with the Karnataka Women Achievers Award for content creation. I shared the news on Instagram, and to my surprise, one of my student’s mothers saw the post. She told her child about it, and my student made a handmade card for me and sent it over.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my god, that is so sweet!</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> It truly was. The card read, “Congratulations, Ragendu Auntie,” and it just melted my heart. Moments like these remind me why I do what I do. The genuine love and support I receive on Instagram—it’s incredible. Even when I meet people in person at events in Bangalore, they tell me, “Oh, you’re just the same as you are online.” And that’s exactly how I want it to be.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! The connection you have with your audience is so authentic. Now, if Instagram didn’t exist, how would you continue sharing your parenting experiences and knowledge?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Oh wow, I can’t even imagine a world without Instagram! My husband and I have actually discussed this—what would I do if Instagram disappeared? And I told him, “Don’t even say that!” But honestly, life wouldn’t stop. Another platform would emerge. We’re already so advanced, and there would always be a way to reach parents. Maybe it would be YouTube, or maybe some new app would take over. Whatever comes up, I’d be there, sharing and connecting just like I do now.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the spirit! Now, if you could collaborate with any brand or influencer, who’s on your dream list?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> I’m not thinking of a big brand right now. My dream is to collaborate with mompreneurs—helping them grow their businesses and supporting each other as we navigate both parenthood and entrepreneurship.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, I love that! That’s so inspiring. So, what’s next for parenting.trail? So, are you still contemplating what exactly to do next, particularly with regard to your work beyond just the page?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, I am planning to expand by introducing a few more courses tailored for parents. The student pipeline is still in progress, so there are exciting projects on the horizon.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds promising! Any particular exciting projects in the works?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Yes, absolutely! There’s something currently in the pipeline that I’m actively working on. Though I’m not entirely sure where it will lead us, I’m optimistic and eager to see how it unfolds.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! Now, throughout your parenting journey, who has been your biggest support system?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Definitely my husband and my parents, and of course, my in-laws. I live in a joint family, so my parents stay with us, while my in-laws are in Kerala. Their support has been instrumental—I truly don’t think I could have achieved anything without them.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! It really does take a village to raise kids. Now, in your opinion, what do you think is the most challenging aspect of modern parenting?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> The biggest challenge is that we’ve moved into a nuclear family setup, which has its benefits. That’s why we choose it, but at the same time, there are difficulties. There’s no one else to take care of the child when you need to focus on something else. You want to do things for yourself, but without that traditional support system, it becomes incredibly difficult. I feel like the biggest struggle we face today is that we no longer have the village that we truly need.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important point. If you could give your younger self one piece of parenting advice, what would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Be present. Just be there for your child. That’s the most valuable advice I can give.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Every family has its quirks. What’s one thing about your family dynamic that always makes you smile?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> At the end of the day, we all come together, and the children start cracking the funniest jokes or singing the silliest songs. That’s our moment. It’s not just me and the child or my husband and the child—it’s the entire family together, laughing and enjoying the time. Even if it’s just for a few moments, I need that. They even try to tickle me just to make me laugh! Those little moments of shared joy are what I love the most.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds so heartwarming! Now, what’s your favorite family-friendly spot for a quick weekend getaway?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Honestly, my home. I love being at home and don’t feel the need to go anywhere. But if I do go for a getaway, it would definitely be Kerala. It’s a wonderful place.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Kerala is truly fabulous! Now, if you could swap lives with any celebrity mom for a day, who would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Alia Bhatt!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very cool choice! Now, let’s talk guilty pleasures. What’s your favorite snack that you secretly enjoy but don’t like to share with your kids?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Ferrero Rocher! My Ferrero Rocher is mine and mine alone. I’m not sharing it with anyone. In fact, I always have a secret stash, and my husband knows it—he’s the one who gets them for me!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s so sweet! A little note to husbands everywhere—take notes!</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Haha, exactly!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fabulous! Now, let’s talk about your morning routine with the kids. Chaos or calm?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> It totally depends on my mood. If I wake up calm, the morning is calm. But if I wake up cranky, then everything turns into chaos!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Time for some rapid-fire questions! Ready?</p>
              <p><strong>Ragendu:</strong> Absolutely!</p>
