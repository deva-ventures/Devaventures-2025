              <p>
              In the ever-evolving world of medicine, few stories stand out as profoundly inspiring as that of Dr Akansha Shrivastava. A leading gynaecologist and laparoscopic surgeon, her journey is one of dedication, resilience, and passion for women’s health. From her unexpected entry into medicine to her groundbreaking work in laparoscopic surgeries, Dr. Shrivastava has dedicated her life to transforming patient care. In this engaging conversation with Devika Majumder, co-founder of the Global Influencers Hub, she shares her experiences, insights, and vision for the future of healthcare.

              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Akansha. Welcome to Global Influencers Hub! Here, we explore the life journeys of influencers, and we are excited to dive into yours.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha Shrivastava:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika. I am really excited to be here and share my journey with you.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s start from the very beginning—your childhood. What was Akanksha like as a child?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> As a child, I was never a top-ranking student. My grades were always in the middle—not too high, not too low. But one thing I always admired about myself was my consistency. No matter what I did, I remained persistent and hardworking. I believe that consistency has played a significant role in shaping my journey.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really interesting. So, when did you first realize your interest in women’s health?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Honestly, I think it was destiny. Until the tenth grade, I had no idea I would become a doctor. I didn’t even consider it. Initially, I was more interested in mathematics—I loved it more than biology. However, my father insisted I take biology, so I ended up choosing it in high school due to his encouragement.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wow! So, it wasn’t something you had planned all along?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Not at all! It was completely unexpected. But once I started studying biology, I gradually developed an interest in it. That’s when I began preparing for the PMT (Pre-Medical Test). Back in 2002-2005 in India, the general mindset was that if you were a science student with biology, you pursued medicine, and if you had mathematics, you went into engineering.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true! It was almost like an unwritten rule.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Exactly! So, I went with the flow and prepared for medical entrance exams. Fortunately, I got into medical school. Looking back, I truly believe it was meant to be.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Now, tell us about the aspect of your work that brings you the most joy—whether it’s laparoscopic surgery, gynecology, or something else. Share some stories; we’d love to hear more about you.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> I genuinely love my profession. Whether it’s taking care of antenatal patients, delivering babies, or performing laparoscopic surgeries, each aspect is unique and equally fulfilling. Practicing obstetrics has its own challenges. You always have to be prepared for emergencies, whether it’s at 2 AM or 6 AM. It requires immediate action. On the other hand, laparoscopic surgeries demand complete vigilance and precision. Honestly, I don’t prefer one over the other—I enjoy both. The thrill of bringing new life into the world and the meticulous skill required in surgery both make my work incredibly rewarding.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What are the most rewarding aspects of performing laparoscopic surgery? Is there a particular case that stands out to you?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Laparoscopic surgery offers numerous advantages over open surgery, except in cases where complications prevent its use. One of the biggest benefits is minimal scarring. Unlike open surgeries, laparoscopic procedures leave little to no visible scars. There is also significantly less bleeding, and the magnified view of internal structures reduces the risk of complications or injury to surrounding organs.</p>
              <p>Another major advantage is quick recovery. Patients are generally encouraged to walk within twelve hours of surgery. Their bowel and bladder functions recover swiftly, and they don’t require prolonged bed rest. Within two to three days, they are almost pain-free. So, in every way, laparoscopic surgery is preferable. However, there are specific cases where it cannot be performed, and in those situations, open surgery remains necessary.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Is there a particular case that you’d like to share?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> At the moment, I can’t recall a specific case. But, in general, we always prioritize laparoscopic surgeries over open surgeries whenever possible.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, do you think there are any common misconceptions among patients regarding laparoscopic surgery that you’d like to clarify?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Absolutely. One of the biggest myths, especially among patients from rural areas, is the fear that because the incision is so small, something might be left inside. They often ask, “Ma’am, will everything be removed properly? How can you take out everything through such a tiny hole? Will I be completely disease-free?”</p>
              <p>This is a complete myth! Laparoscopic surgeries are not only effective but, in many ways, even better than open surgeries. The procedure provides a magnified view, allowing for greater precision. There are specific techniques to remove organs safely, which we may not always explain in detail to patients, but rest assured, nothing is left behind.</p>
              <p>For example, if I am performing a uterus removal surgery, the entire uterus is removed—whether through open or laparoscopic surgery. The belief that something will be left inside is entirely false. Laparoscopic surgery is just as thorough, if not more, than open surgery.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. That makes so much sense. Now, how do you approach patients who are nervous about undergoing surgery, particularly gynecological procedures? Do you have any calming techniques? How do you personally handle this aspect of patient care?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> It’s natural for anyone facing surgery to feel anxious. Even as a doctor, I feel nervous when a relative or loved one has to undergo surgery. It’s a completely human response.</p>
              <p>The most important thing we do is provide thorough explanations. Patients need to understand their condition, the necessity of the procedure, the duration, and the type of anesthesia used. Breaking down the entire process for them and their families reduces at least fifty percent of their anxiety. Clear communication plays a critical role in easing their fears.</p>
              <p>Beyond that, continuous reassurance is key. We encourage them to have faith—faith in the doctors, faith in themselves, and, if they are spiritual, faith in God. I often tell them, “We are in this together. You pray, and I will do my best. Together, we will move forward with trust.” This connection and dialogue help make them feel secure and significantly less fearful.</p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes a lot of sense. So, you try
                to have an open dialogue with the patient. Now, another widely
                discussed topic is the debate between natural childbirth and
                C-section deliveries. How do you help an expectant mother make
                that choice? What’s your approach to guiding them?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Natural birth is definitely better
                for both the mother and baby. It’s the way nature intended—
                without surgical cuts or interventions. We always prefer natural
                birth and guide mothers throughout their pregnancy with
                exercises, dietary recommendations, and mental preparation to
                increase the chances of a natural delivery.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mental readiness is crucial, as some patients are not prepared
                for the intensity of labor pain. We put in a lot of effort to
                help them become both physically and mentally strong for natural
                birth.
              </p>

              <p>
                In India, particularly in the region where I practice, most
                people prefer natural delivery over a cesarean section. However,
                there are situations where a C-section becomes necessary for the
                safety of both mother and baby. In such cases, a C-section
                should be considered a second option when natural delivery is
                not feasible.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. True. Now, let’s talk a
                little bit about mental health during pregnancy. Can you give
                some tips to women who may struggle with anxiety or just overall
                emotional well-being during that time?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Mood swings are very common during
                pregnancy, primarily due to hormonal changes. One moment, you’re
                happy; the next, you might find yourself crying or feeling upset
                for no apparent reason. It’s completely natural. Sometimes, you
                may even have disagreements with your partner or family members,
                only to later wonder what the argument was even about.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first step is to help the patient—and especially their
                partner and close family members—understand that mood swings are
                a normal part of pregnancy. It’s crucial for their support
                system to be patient, understanding, and to provide extra care
                and pampering during this time.
              </p>

              <p>
                The second key aspect is proactively managing mental health. I
                often recommend activities like yoga, meditation, and listening
                to calming music. If an expectant mother is feeling low,
                engaging in these activities can be incredibly beneficial.
                Reading is another great way to relax and stay
                informed—whether it’s spiritual books, pregnancy-related
                literature, or parenting guides. Maintaining a positive mindset
                and staying well-informed can significantly help in reducing
                anxiety and nervousness.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Now, what are the key things
                you wish all women knew about their reproductive health? And do
                you think some factors could potentially complicate things in
                the future?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Absolutely. One of the most
                important aspects, particularly here in India, is nutritional
                deficiency. Whether it’s a 15-year-old adolescent girl, a
                25-year-old young woman, or a 40-year-old adult, there is a
                massive deficiency—especially in iron, vitamin D, and calcium.
                What’s concerning is that most people are unaware of it. Many
                experience irritation, fatigue, or unexplained mood swings
                without understanding the root cause. Research now reveals that
                vitamin D3 deficiency is closely linked to hormonal changes, yet
                people continue taking hormonal medications without realizing
                that a simple vitamin D3 supplement could address the issue.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really eye-opening. You’re
                saying that something as simple as maintaining proper vitamin
                and mineral levels could prevent these problems?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Exactly! People don’t realize how
                essential these nutrients are. Vitamin D, calcium, and iron play
                a crucial role in a woman’s overall health, yet their deficiency
                is rampant. Unfortunately, many women do not take calcium or
                iron supplements during pregnancy or even after childbirth when
                they are breastfeeding. This is a critical time because studies
                show that women lose 3 to 5% of their bone mass while
                breastfeeding. If they don’t take proper calcium and vitamin D3
                supplementation, they are at risk of long-term health
                complications.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s alarming! So, for women at
                different stages of life, from adolescence to motherhood, the
                key is to maintain proper nutrition?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Absolutely. The most important
                takeaway is that every woman should be mindful of her
                nutritional intake. Get tested, consult a doctor, and take
                supplements as needed. If we are properly nourished, everything
                in our body functions better—our hormones stay balanced, our
                organs work efficiently, and even the aging process slows down.
                Nutrition is the foundation of good reproductive health, and
                women need to take it seriously.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, do you suggest that women above a
                certain age should take specific supplements like you just
                mentioned regardless? Or should they get tested first and then
                take the supplements?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> If you're at high risk—such as
                being pregnant, breastfeeding, premenopausal, or
                postmenopausal—you should take vitamin D3 and calcium
                supplements regardless of any prescription. These are essential
                nutrients that your body needs at those stages. However, if you
                don’t fall into these high-risk categories, it’s always best to
                consult your doctor and get tested. If you are found to be
                deficient, then you can take the necessary supplements.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most importantly, women should never ignore any symptoms. If
                your body is showing persistent symptoms for more than two
                weeks, don’t overlook them. For instance, if you previously had
                normal menstrual cycles but are now experiencing irregular or
                abnormal bleeding, or if you have persistent vaginal discharge,
                itching, or discomfort in the perineal region—these could be
                warning signs. Even symptoms like a persistent cough lasting
                more than two or three weeks should not be ignored. Always visit
                your doctor if something feels off.
              </p>

              <p>
                Women often prioritize their children, husbands, and families,
                but they tend to neglect their own health. It’s essential to pay
                attention to your body and seek medical help when needed.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah. And sadly, in India, cervical
                cancer and breast cancer cases are on the rise. Despite the
                availability of tests and screenings, many women are diagnosed
                at an advanced stage—stage three or stage four—which is truly
                heartbreaking.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> That is true.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, here’s an interesting question. If
                you weren’t a laparoscopic surgeon, gynecologist, or OB-GYN,
                what do you think you would be doing?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Well, that’s a great question!
                Actually, I think I would have been a teacher.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Alright.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yes, because I have always loved
                learning and sharing knowledge. I used to enjoy teaching others
                whatever I learned. I believe that my passion for teaching is
                what led me to start sharing medical knowledge on social media.
                It allows me to educate a larger audience about women’s health
                and well-being. So, if I hadn’t become a doctor, I’m sure I
                would have pursued teaching.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! We’ll definitely talk
                more about your social media presence soon. But before that,
                tell us—what is your favorite tool in the operating room? Do you
                have one?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Maybe the scalpel, because
                everything starts with it. It is the most fundamental tool for a
                surgeon. So, yes, the scalpel is my favorite tool.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, if you could have a superpower for
                a day, what would it be and why?
              </p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> One of the saddest things I see in my profession is the disappointment people feel when they have a second or third baby girl. This is especially true in India. Even among relatives, parents, and sometimes even the mother herself, there is a sense of distress.</p>
              <p>If I had a superpower for a day, I would erase this mindset. I would want every parent to embrace their daughters with happiness and pride. I would ensure that every girl child is given the opportunities and love she deserves, without any discrimination based on gender.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful thought. You would want to replace that negativity with love and acceptance.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Exactly!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Absolutely. So tell us, what is next for Dr. Akansha Shrivastava?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> The future plan is all about growth—both personally and professionally. As I always say, everyone is learning daily, and I am no exception. Apart from my current endeavors, I will always strive to grow academically and surgically.</p>
              <p>In the next few years, as my children grow up, I plan to focus on advancing my expertise in robotic surgery. I am eager to attend workshops and pursue fellowships in this specialized field. The goal is to keep evolving and mastering new techniques to provide the best care possible.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Continuous learning is the key. Now, how would you like to be remembered by the medical community?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> I would always want people to have faith in me—that when they come to me, everything will be alright.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, you mean your patients and colleagues should always feel assured that they are in capable hands?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Exactly. If someone seeks out Dr. Akansha Shrivastava, I want them to know that they will receive good advice and the best possible care. Surgically, I want to be recognized as someone skilled and trustworthy, someone whom people can refer to without a second thought. That is how I want to be remembered in the medical community.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Perfect. Very cool. Now tell us about your social media journey…</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! Thanks to you for that. Now, let’s talk about your followers—your fan moments. You have a strong fan following.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yeah.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, how do you interact with them? Have you had any memorable experiences—DMs, comments, or moments that stood out?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Oh, absolutely! It’s such a wonderful feeling. Social media has allowed me to connect not just with people in my city but across India and even internationally. I have patients reaching out to me for consultations from outside India as well.</p>
              <p>I often receive DMs from followers saying, “Ma’am, I followed you throughout my pregnancy, and your content helped clear all my doubts. I’m now blessed with a baby boy or a baby girl.” Some even send me pictures of their babies, telling me they’ve been following me from the U.S., Canada, or other countries.</p>
              <p>That, to me, is truly incredible. It’s not just about where I live—it’s about making a global impact.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You really are making a global impact.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yeah, and it’s deeply fulfilling on an emotional level. It reminds me that what I’m doing is meaningful. Seeing people appreciate my work and my page motivates me to keep going. I know I have to keep improving and expanding this platform to reach and help even more people.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Perfect, perfect! Absolutely. Now, let’s jump into some rapid-fire questions.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Okay!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could switch lives with any other doctor for a day, which specialty would you choose?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> If I had to step away from gynecology, I’d choose pediatrics—because I absolutely love children. If I don’t get to deliver my babies, I’d at least get to spend time with them and other little ones.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Excellent choice. Now, what would you say is the most underrated part of being a surgeon?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> The fact that your life is completely consumed by work. People see the skill and precision, but they don’t always realize the constant stress we’re under. Surgery itself is incredibly intense—it keeps our adrenaline levels high, and even after the procedure, we’re always on edge, thinking about potential complications. As a gynecologist, I’m never truly off-duty. Emergency calls, midnight surgeries—it’s all part of the job. It’s a demanding profession, both physically and emotionally.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, that’s a huge responsibility. So tell us, what’s your secret weapon for staying calm under pressure?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> My firm faith in God. That faith gives me confidence and keeps me grounded, no matter how high-pressure the situation.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. And what’s one word your patients use to describe you?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Most of my patients call me a “smiling doctor.”</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And you are! You absolutely are.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> They often say, “You’ll always find a smile on her face. Even if you ask her the same question 15 times, she’ll still smile and answer.”</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. And it makes such a difference—when patients see their doctor smiling, it automatically gives them confidence and reassurance.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yeah.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And I think that’s very important. Most patients nowadays tend to look up their symptoms on Google before consulting a doctor. How do you handle that?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yes, that happens quite often. Many patients come in having read about their condition online, and they already have a preconceived notion about what’s wrong with them. But in those moments, I just smile and take care of them. I make sure they feel comfortable with me, reassuring them that they are in the right hands.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great approach. Now, if you could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> I would tell my younger self to prioritize my health alongside my work. During MBBS and MS, it’s easy to get so caught up in studying and training that we completely neglect our well-being.</p>
              <p>For nearly ten to twelve years, I didn’t focus on my health. But now, I’ve realized how important it is. Over the past two to three years, I’ve made a conscious effort to maintain a balanced lifestyle—eating healthy, exercising regularly, meditating, and taking care of my mental and physical well-being. I wish I had started earlier, but I’m grateful I’m doing it now.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such valuable advice—not just for doctors, but for everyone, especially women who often put everything else before themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Absolutely! Everyone needs to understand that self-care is not a luxury; it’s a necessity.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Moving on, what’s your favorite motivational quote to start your day?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> The one that always stays with me is: Consistency is the key. Circumstances change, our mood fluctuates, and our capacity to handle situations varies from day to day. But if we remain consistent, things will eventually improve. It may take time, but consistency will always lead us to our goals.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful statement. Consistency truly is a game-changer in every field and every aspect of life.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Exactly. If we stay consistent, no matter the challenges, we will ultimately reach our destination. A hundred percent.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what’s your biggest inspiration—either in the medical field or in life in general?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> My biggest inspiration is to fulfill my purpose in life. I truly believe that everyone should have a purpose because without one, life lacks direction. A strong sense of purpose keeps us driven, and we should work toward it every single day.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a profound thought. We’d love to know—what is Dr. Akansha’s purpose?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> That’s a secret for now. I wouldn’t reveal it just yet.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> No problem! We’ll keep that a secret then. Now, what’s your favorite way to celebrate after a successful surgery?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> I always celebrate with my entire team. Surgery is never a one-person job—we all work together, so I make sure the whole OT team, board members, and management come together. We usually cut a cake or bring sweets, and I let them order whatever they’d like. Success should always be shared, and I love celebrating our achievements as a team.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful, and so well deserved. Now, what is your life mantra?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> My life mantra consists of two things: firm faith in God and karma.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Yes, having faith in God gives you the strength to face anything in life. It reassures you that no matter what happens, you are being guided and protected. The second is karma. I believe in doing my karma sincerely, and when you do that, the universe aligns itself to support you.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. I completely resonate with that—it’s a belief I hold close to my heart as well. It was so wonderful chatting with you, Akansha.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Thank you, Devika!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wishing you all the best in everything you do. Doctors are truly a blessing from God.</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Akansha:</strong> Thank you so much.</p>
