          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          Indrajit Lahiri, a passionate storyteller, author, IT professional, and one of the most loved food content creators in Bengal, recently joined Devika Majumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, for a heartwarming conversation. Best known for Foodka, his digital avatar that captures Bengal’s food culture with wit and depth, Indrajit’s journey from a book-loving child to an influential voice in India’s culinary content space is rooted in authenticity, simplicity, and deep love for food and culture. In this candid chat, he opens up about his early life, the values that shaped him, and the organic evolution of Foodka. Here’s a glimpse into their conversation:
          </p>
       
              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sweta. Welcome to Global Influencers Hub.</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta Desai:</strong> Hi! Thank you so much. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’re so excited to dive into your journey — not just the social media side of it, but the real story behind the search results. And when I say we want to know all about you, I mean we’re going back to childhood! So tell us… what was little Sweta like?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Sweta as a child... wow, that feels like ages ago! But if I try to remember, I was really naughty! </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! Naughty and nice, I hope?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh yes, definitely nice too. But honestly, I was also very studious. A bit of both, I guess.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a fun mix! Now tell me, who played the biggest role in shaping your early life?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My mom — definitely. She’s always been my foundation. Right or wrong, day or night — she’s stood by me no matter what.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the true essence of a mother, isn’t it?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. But she’s more than just a mother to me — she’s my best friend. I can share anything with her.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. So, after your schooling years, how did your journey unfold? What steps did you take?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Well, I did my schooling at Aroma, and then college from HLCC. Like I said, I was quite studious — I even pursued a diploma in French from Orléans. After that, I completed my post-graduation in finance and analysis — I’ve done my M.Com, and also an MBA.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow — that's quite an academic portfolio!</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, I was always eager to learn. I also got married early — I was just 20. But that phase didn’t last very long, and after that, I really began focusing on building my career.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So when did the creative spark — the fashion calling — really strike?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I didn’t work for a long time during my early years. But around the age of 35, I started exploring designing. That was when it all clicked — I realized I wanted to be financially independent, to create something of my own. And my family supported me wholeheartedly.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. Now tell us about Pistachio by Sweta! We absolutely love the name, by the way!</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Thank you! But honestly, there’s no big story behind the name — it was a random pick. It just felt right, and it stuck!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, Pistachio by Sweta — where did the name come from? We love it, but is there a story behind it?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? No story. Just… a lot of randomness. It happened all of a sudden.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you love pistachios?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I like them, yes. But what I really love is pistachio baklava — that’s one of my absolute favorites!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> See! That is something! There’s the connection.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Maybe. Actually, when I was searching for a brand name, I came across the word "pistachio" — and I saw a logo somewhere with two cute pistachios. It caught my attention. It just felt right. So I went with it. There’s no deep logic or story behind it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And that’s the beauty of it. Naming a brand — like naming a child — doesn’t always need logic. It just needs to feel like you.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. Although I do get this a lot — people often ask me, “Is this a food brand or a clothing brand?”</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, I can imagine! But that curiosity actually helps, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It does. It sticks in people’s minds. And now many people know me only as Pistachio by Sweta. They don’t even know my real name — and that feels like such a proud moment.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an achievement — to create a brand identity so strong that it speaks for itself. But take us back — how did the journey really begin? What were the early challenges?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> The early days were full of struggles. Honestly, every other building now has a clothing brand, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> So, in such a competitive space, making your name stand out is not easy. I had to push through all that noise. I wanted people to know me through my brand — and that’s exactly what happened over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must feel incredibly rewarding.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It does. I started off by participating in exhibitions — in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi — wherever I could. And let me tell you, those days were hard. For a one-day exhibition, I would leave home at 3 or 4 AM and return the same night at 1 or 2 AM. It was exhausting, but I gave it my all.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s intense. But clearly, the hard work paid off.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, it did. Slowly but surely. And that phase — as hard as it was — shaped who I am today.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Success never comes easy, but when it does come, it makes the journey worth every second.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s a lot of work, Sweta. And that’s exactly why we want to dig into the real effort behind the brand. Because from the outside, it might look effortless — but we know it isn’t.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh, absolutely. It takes a lot of hard work and I’d say, more than anything, commitment. But not just consistency, because consistency doesn’t mean just going with the flow. You can’t sit back and say, “It’s going on, it’s fine.” No! That mindset won’t work.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, you need that fire. That drive to show up every single day.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. You need to stay involved. Keep pushing.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So let’s talk fashion now. How do you see the connection between fashion and personal expression?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I truly believe fashion is all about comfort first. If you’re not comfortable, it’s not fashion for you. It also defines who you are — your personality, your vibe. Even something as simple as a clean white T-shirt and blue jeans can speak volumes. Fashion doesn’t need to be flashy. It’s how you carry it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. It's your first impression before you even speak.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Right! It’s about knowing what suits you. Not just blindly following trends. That self-awareness — of what enhances your natural beauty, your glow — that’s real style. And I’m not talking about body shaming at all. I mean, just be honest with yourself about what brings out your best. It’s not about wearing shorts or full sleeves — it’s about what works for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful point — fashion should empower, not restrict.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. And I think today’s trends are also moving toward more simplicity and elegance. Yes, I wear sleeveless and short clothes too — I have no issues with it — but I really feel that full-sleeve, graceful outfits are making a comeback. Elegance is always in trend.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And there’s no replacement for elegance.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> None at all. Simplicity with elegance — that’s my mantra for fashion.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s shift to Instagram now — your feed is so creative and consistent. How did that journey begin?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Very honestly, my entry into Instagram was purely for my brand. Pistachio by Sweta was my baby, and I wanted to grow it. But I quickly realized, it’s not enough to just post about the brand. You have to be seen — be vocal, be social.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes — people don’t just buy products, they connect with personalities.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly! You can’t just sit in your boutique and go home — you need to interact. That’s how people begin to know you. And that’s how new opportunities come. I started getting approached for lifestyle blogging, for influencing, for collaborations. And I embraced it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So it's all interconnected, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Totally. When you branch out — meet new people, attend events, collaborate — you’re not just growing personally, you’re also expanding your brand visibility. Everything works hand-in-hand. The more you’re out there, the more people know you, and that naturally reflects on your work.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. It’s all about showing up — online and offline.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes. If you stay in one lane, no one will notice. But when you widen your road, everything flows together.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I’m also a professor at GLS — I take fashion lectures there.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful! So you're directly in touch with the new generation — Gen Z. That must give you such insights into their tastes and preferences.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. Interacting with them constantly helps you understand what they like, how they think. And that influences so much. You can’t stay in one place — you have to move with the times.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So in today’s world, do you think a designer also needs to be a digital influencer?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> 100% yes. I strongly believe they should be. Because right now, digital influence is the fastest way to connect with people. Everyone’s on Instagram. Who’s reading newspapers or magazines anymore? If you want growth in your business, you have to be out there. Period.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Spot on. Now, how do you stay authentic while putting yourself out there on social media?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? Just be yourself. That’s the simplest way. You don’t need to act or pretend. If you pretend to be someone else, you’ll have to carry that burden every day. Why do that? Be who you are — and things fall into place.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that. Now tell us — what are some absolute must-haves in every woman’s wardrobe?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Grooming. It’s not about expensive outfits — but please be groomed. You can wear jeans and a T-shirt, that’s totally fine — but make sure your hair is neat, your nails are clean. That’s the least you can do for yourself. If you can’t do that, you can’t do anything for anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Self-care speaks louder than labels.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. Groom yourself. It's basic respect to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now for aspiring designers — what’s the one skill they really need today?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> They need to be with the generation. Be practical. If Gen Z likes something, try to understand why — don’t dismiss it. If you disagree, that’s okay — but don’t criticize. Bridge the gap. Try to learn from them. That openness makes all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so insightful. Many people go into criticism mode instead of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, and that’s not helpful. I always say — be positive. Don’t criticize — analyze. Ask why. If you’re rigid or stubborn, you won’t grow. Accept the change. Learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the mindset that leads to real growth. Now, let’s talk about sustainable fashion — what’s your take?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My advice is — don’t be ashamed of reusing your clothes. Please don’t. You don’t need 365 different outfits for 365 days. Mix and match! Wear that black skirt with a pink top one day, and a white shirt the next. Reuse. Restyle. And you’ll look just as elegant — maybe even more.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So simple. So powerful. And finally — your advice to young fashion creators?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly, I feel the younger generation is advising us! And I love it. Some of the ideas they come up with — even we don’t think that way. And I happily accept it. If someone who's 18 comes to me and says, “Ma’am, try this” — I’m like, wow, I didn’t even know this existed!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a refreshing attitude.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Everyone has their own fashion sense. And I’m truly proud of the younger generation — they’re independent, fearless, and so creative. It makes me hopeful for the future of fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> You know, when we were 18, we really didn’t know much about the world.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, absolutely not. So true.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> We were scared of asking simple things — like even telling our dad, “I want to go out.” We’d hesitate, think twice, maybe ask for permission nervously.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Totally relatable. Things were very different.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, completely.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, on the rare day when you're not designing, influencing, curating, or teaching — what’s a day in Sweta Desai’s life like?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I do absolutely nothing. And I truly mean that. Nothing is also a kind of work for me.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And very necessary! Stillness is a form of therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It really is. Because, you know, my calendar is packed most of the time — from fashion design to lectures, luxury event curation influencing. So when I get that one empty day — I treasure it. That nothingness is peace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And now you’ve also started traveling abroad for fashion?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes! That’s been another exciting chapter. I’ve started attending international events — London Fashion Week, Milan, and Paris Fashion Week. It’s been amazing. But again, when I’m home and doing nothing — that’s my reset button.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that balance — full calendar, but also full awareness of when to pause. Now, tell us — who is your biggest fashion inspiration?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It has to be Sushmita Sen.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful choice! She’s iconic.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> She truly is. Her poise, elegance, and confidence — she represents inner strength more than just outer fashion. That’s what inspires me. She carries herself with such grace, and she’s always herself. That’s real style.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So tell us — what’s your guilty pleasure outside of work?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Street food. No question.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love it! Any particular favorite?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Pani puri. But not the homemade kind — it has to be street-style.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! It’s not real pani puri unless it’s slightly unhygienic, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly! If it’s too clean, you’re probably going to fall sick anyway, so it might as well be worth it!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s something people would be surprised to know about you?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> That I’m actually quite introverted. I have very strong boundaries. Even though I meet hundreds of people through work, only four or five are in my close circle. That space is sacred to me.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so interesting, because you're so social by profession.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, but that's the job. I have to be cordial and warm with everyone — but that doesn’t mean I open up to everyone. I stay guarded, and that’s how I protect my peace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you weren’t a designer today, what would you be?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> A chef or a restaurateur! I love to cook. Name a cuisine — Gujarati, Rajasthani, Punjabi, South Indian, Chinese, Lebanese, Italian — I cook them all.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my goodness! That’s amazing. So cooking is your hobby?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It’s a hobby, a form of relaxation, a creative outlet — everything rolled into one. For me, cooking is therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. Now, tell us — what’s the one achievement you’re most proud of?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Walking international ramps — Paris, Milan, London Fashion Week — has been a dream come true. For so many young designers, it’s a fantasy. And I’m so grateful to God, and to everyone who supported me, that I could experience it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What a powerful moment that must have been. And how do you feel Pistachio by Sweta has evolved since you started?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh, it’s evolved so much. When strangers walk up to me in a mall or store and say, “Aren’t you Pistachio?”, it’s a surreal feeling. Some people don’t even know my real name — they just know Pistachio. That makes me incredibly proud. I started with a small clothing line, and today, I’ve built a name. That’s my biggest achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And it’s so well-deserved. You’ve built more than a brand — you’ve built yourself through it.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I feel so happy when people come up to me and say, “Oh, I know you!” It makes all the hard work worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Now tell us — are there any collaborations or dream projects in the works?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Some are in the pipeline. I can’t share too much yet, but yes, there are collaborations I’m analysing right now. Interestingly, I’ve had offers for web series and even movies — but honestly, that’s not my forte. I’m not interested in going that route.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Makes sense — it’s all about staying in your own lane. What’s next for your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I’m working on a new collection for the monsoon. But before that, there’s another major event happening in May, which I need to prepare for. After that, I’ll focus entirely on the upcoming line for Pistachio.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, Sweta — let’s end with a fun rapid-fire. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Ready!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Coffee or Chai?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Chai.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Heels or Sneakers?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Definitely heels.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I had a feeling you’d say that! Favorite fabric to work with?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Satin.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One celebrity you’d love to dress?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Deepika Padukone.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Monochrome or Brights?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Monochrome.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> City you feel most stylish in?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Milan.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, Milan. Same here — did you shop a lot when you went?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Of course! (laughs) Women and shopping — you know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Three things always in your bag?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Money, phone, and my perfume.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite color palette?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Burnt orange and black.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word that defines your style?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Elegance.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, what’s your biggest pet peeve in fashion?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? None. I go with the flow.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lipstick or eyeliner?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Eyeliner.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite fashion era?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> The Twenties — all that glamour and grace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word that describes Pistachio by Sweta?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My baby.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Aww, that’s so sweet. If you had a message to your younger self, what would it be?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I wish I had started this earlier. But no regrets — we’re doing it now, and we’re doing it well.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So well. If your life was a book, what would you title it?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Be Yourself. Be honest. Be honest to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. And so real. Because that’s where authenticity begins.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes. If you want to go far, there’s no other way. You can’t take shortcuts. Anyone can copy anyone — but you are you. That’s your power. Why try to be someone else? Own who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sweta, this has been such a wonderful conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Same here. I truly enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I wish you a speedy recovery for your foot — we need you at full power for Cannes!</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Thank you so much. I was feeling low today, but this really lifted my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That means a lot. Before we end, can you share a few words about our platform — Global Influencer Hub?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. Devika, honestly — I loved talking to you. In just a short time, you helped me revisit my entire journey — from my childhood to now. You and your team are doing such commendable work. It takes courage to support and spotlight people like this. You're helping others grow, and that’s outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you — truly. That means so much.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It was an absolute pleasure. And I hope we meet very soon — I’m sure we will.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> We will. The universe will make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Bye, Devika.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye, Sweta.</p>
<p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Indrajit, to Global Influencers Hub! Here, we explore the life journeys of social media influencers. This is the creator economy, and today is about getting to know you. From Indrajit Lahiri to Foodka, it’s been an amazing journey. Let’s go back a bit and start with your childhood.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit Lahiri:</strong> Hmm... sure. I was a regular Bengali kid, growing up in the late 70s and 80s. There was no internet then, but life was fun. We had a lot of friends and spent time outdoors. It was a good time—simple and joyful.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Were you the mischievous one, the bookworm, or the adventurous type?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Definitely a bookworm. Very much so. Though honestly, my mother would’ve been the best person to answer that! (laughs) But yes, books were a big part of my childhood.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s sweet. Is there a cherished memory from your school days that really stands out?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Nothing very specific, to be honest. I went to a regular Bengali medium school, but we had a good group of friends. Some of them are still close even today.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s lovely! Were there any particular teachers or friends who left a strong impact?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Not really—no one in particular comes to mind. It was more about the collective experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Were there any hobbies or passions from childhood that still influence you today?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Books, without a doubt. They’ve stayed with me through every phase of life.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. Any favorite book that you go back to, something that lifts you up?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I read a lot of Bengali literature. A few English books here and there, but mostly Bengali. Two that have stayed with me over decades are Madhukori and Shabnam. They’ve really left a mark.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Beautiful. Now, what’s a value or lesson your family instilled in you that you still carry?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Patience. That everything happens at its right time. It won’t happen earlier, and it won’t happen later. It’s one of those life truths that has stayed with me.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Timing is everything. I completely agree. It’s amazing how that realization deepens with time.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Exactly.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now since this is Foodka’s story, we have to talk about food! What’s your fondest childhood memory related to food?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Back then, eating out wasn’t common. It wasn’t like now, where people order in or go out twice a week. Eating out was an event. Maybe once a month or every two months, our family would go out—my father, mother, and I. We’d have a nice meal and come back. It was about the experience, not just the food.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, it was really about the joy of going out as a family?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Absolutely. The outing itself was more exciting than the food sometimes!</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds so wholesome. Who was the biggest foodie in your family?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> (laughs) See, back then the term “foodie” didn’t even exist. But everyone in a Bengali family appreciates good food. So, I’d say all of us were food lovers in our own way.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. Any particular dish—“maa ke haath ka khana”—that still stays with you?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Oh yes, definitely. My mom and my Jethima (aunt) cooked all our meals. We didn’t have a cook or anything fancy. It was humble, everyday Bengali food, but made with love. I’ve grown up on that. Maybe macher jhol or luchi torkari—simple but full of warmth.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds delicious! So, tell us—before Foodka, what did life look like for Indrajit Lahiri?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Foodka is quite new—it’s just 7 years old. I’ve been working for over 22-23 years. My main career has always been in IT. I still run an IT company. Before that, I worked at Hewlett Packard for about 6-7 years. So, yes, I was deep into the corporate world before Foodka happened.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And what was that journey like—from college to corporate?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I started in college in Bhubaneswar. My first job was at Hyatt Regency—I thought I’d be a chef! But within 8 months, I realized that was not for me. I’d make a terrible chef (laughs). So, I moved to sales and marketing, worked in various companies, and eventually left HP to start my own venture—Pickle Solutions. It’s an IT firm and we’re strong partners with big players like HP even today.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. So how did Foodka begin? What was that defining moment?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> There wasn’t really a dramatic moment. I met Mir Afsar Ali during a food trail organized by the Times Group. He’s a foodie, I’m a foodie—we connected instantly. He wanted a partner for a new idea, and I was the choice. I had already been writing my blog Moha Mushkil since 2010—it’s still active, by the way. Then in September 2017, Foodka was born. It just… happened.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, how was that very first experience of Foodka? Do you remember what the first episode was?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Oh yes, I remember. Honestly, I was learning the ropes back then because I had never been in showbiz before. I was always a corporate guy. So, for maybe the first 10–15 episodes, I was just figuring things out. I’d say I was only 20% there at that time. Even now, I’m still learning. It’s not a problem—but back then, adapting to the new setup was definitely a challenge.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> The whole process—shooting, scripting, everything?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> The entire learning curve, yes. It’s still ongoing. We’re always evolving, trying to get better.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Learning never stops. I think we’re all lifelong learners in this journey. Speaking of which, was there a defining moment in your journey where everything changed?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Probably the day I met Mir on that food trail. If not for that, we may have never crossed paths. He was already a celebrity back then. That meeting changed everything. I’d say that was the turning point.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely, that kind of connection can be life-changing. What would you say has been the biggest risk you’ve taken in life so far?</p>
               
          <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Leaving my stable job at Hewlett Packard when my son was barely one-and-a-half or two years old. That was a huge leap of faith. I had no clue whether it would turn out good, bad, or ugly. But yes, it was the boldest move I’ve ever made. And here we are—my company is almost 12 years old now. In fact, I’m talking to you right now from that same office!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. And I can tell you’re proud of that decision. Fantastic! Now, we all face setbacks. Is there one failure that taught you a powerful life lesson?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Oh, many—countless, actually. Failures happen every single day. I’m in my mid-forties, and I’ve seen plenty. But they’re not always bad. In fact, they’re great teachers. The key is to learn from them and grow. You may avoid the same mistake next time… or maybe not. But the effort matters.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Was there one particular failure that left a lasting lesson?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Yes—my 12th board exams. I didn’t do well at all. I had started enjoying life a bit too much after Class 10, got distracted, and didn’t put in the effort. That regret has stayed with me. It wasn’t anyone else’s fault—it was completely mine.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s great that you take ownership of it. Not everyone does.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> It has to be that way. No one else is to blame.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True. If you could relive one day from your past, which one would it be?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> None, actually. I don’t want to go back. What’s done is done.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a wonderful way to look at life. Let’s talk a bit about your personal life. Who has been the biggest influence in your life?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> My son. He’s 14 now, and he has completely changed my life.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. Can you share more about how he’s influenced you?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Something shifted in me when he came into our lives. It was transformative. He completed us. You know, I feel “influencer” is a highly overused term today—but if I had to choose someone, it would be him.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly moving. Now here’s a fun one—if you could have dinner with three people from history, who would they be and why?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Hmm... Charlie Chaplin, Adolf Hitler, and Kishore Kumar. One was a genius of planned madness. One—Hitler—we still can’t fully understand. And Kishore Kumar, well… he was brilliantly unpredictable.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a very unique trio! What about your personal philosophy—what keeps you going during tough times?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Just stay. Just be there. Keep evolving, keep learning. It may sound cliché, but “tough times never last, tough people do”—it actually works. Stay afloat. Keep your mind steady. Somehow, things always work out.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s powerful. Now, how do you manage to balance everything—your content creation, running your IT company, family life?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I think I operate in a “switch-on, switch-off” mode. Like right now, I’m here at Global Influencers Hub, doing this interview. At this moment, I’m not thinking about Foodka, or Pickle Solutions, or home. I focus on one thing at a time. Otherwise, it’s impossible to juggle it all. We men can usually handle only one thing at a time, right? (laughs) So, I finish one, switch off, and move on to the next.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great strategy. The switch-on, switch-off approach really does seem effective.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> It works for me. Maybe others can try it too. It might help.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Definitely. A great takeaway for many! Now, when we think about the books and movies we grew up with, which one do you think had a profound impact on your life?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times. That one really stayed with me. And of course, Sholay.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sholay, classic!</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Just to clarify, Sholay isn’t by J.P. Dutta—just mentioning, in case anyone gets confused. But yeah, Sholay and Modern Times. Timeless.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. You know, I was thinking about the same question while I was asking you. For me, it’s Life is Beautiful. Such a powerful film.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Oh yes, brilliant movie.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It really shaped how I think about life.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I don’t understand why it’s not available on any OTT platform in India. It’s on Telegram if you really want to find it, but nowhere legally.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true. I used to own a copy, but I’m not sure where it is now. It’s such a shame—it should be easily accessible.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Right? That film deserves to be seen by everyone. It’s that impactful.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, if your life were a movie, what would the title be? And who would play you?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Hmm. That’s a tough one. It really depends on someone else’s perspective. But if I had to name it—maybe Ebong Indrajit. Or even better, Ebong Foodka.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting! What does Ebong Foodka mean?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I like short names. Monosyllables. So Ebong Foodka feels right. If something comes out of it, I’m game.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. Now tell me—what’s a hidden talent or skill that people don’t usually know about you?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I’m a great toilet singer.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow, there you go!</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I mean, I don’t always stay in tune, but that doesn’t matter. I enjoy it, and that’s what counts.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly. If it makes you happy, that’s all that matters.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Also, I’m a pampering father. I spoil my kid silly.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so sweet. Okay, now tell me the three things you absolutely need with you—apart from your phone.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Oh, I actually switch off my phone data often. So I’d say—a good book, silence, and my bike. Definitely not the car. The bike gives me freedom.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that. Now, if you could swap lives with anyone for a day, who would it be?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> My son. I’d love to relive his school days—he’s in Class 8 now. I want to feel that carefree, curious energy again.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so heartfelt. What’s the most adventurous or spontaneous thing you’ve ever done?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Well, once I drove around 500 kilometers—Bhubaneswar to Kolkata—overnight. I was young and in my prime. It was crazy. I wouldn’t dare try that now.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wild!</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Yeah, but I survived! And I’ve got the story to prove it.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the beauty of adventure, right? The stories stay with us.</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> They do. They keep us alive.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So what would your younger self say if they saw where you are today?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Probably—“Glad you survived.” And I’d tell them, “Think rationally. Don’t just follow your heart—it’s nonsense. Use your brain. That top floor exists for a reason.”</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I hear you! Now, switching gears to food again. What’s the craziest or most adventurous thing you’ve eaten during your Foodka travels?</p>

      <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> When we were in Meghalaya, we tried fried insects. Didn’t show it on camera, but we did try them. Their local food is fascinating—Northeast cuisine is extreme and incredibly diverse.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. Food really does have its own stories. Which dish you’ve covered had the most fascinating story?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Honestly, the simplest meals. Everyday dal. Everyday machher jhol. These humble dishes are full of soul. They are the true stories, the ones that matter.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful thought.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Every machher jhol has a story. Every dal, every sambar—each one tells a tale. That’s what food is all about.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now tell me—do you think there’s a street food gem in Kolkata or anywhere in India that deserves international recognition?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Honestly, there's nothing that qualifies as a hidden gem anymore. Everything’s been discovered. Content creators, bloggers, TV shows—they’ve covered it all. But yes, Kolkata is definitely one of the street food capitals of India. No doubt about that.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fair point. But is there one dish in particular that you feel should’ve gotten international attention?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Jhal muri. Absolutely. It’s vegan, DIY, and suits almost every palate. It’s versatile, flavorful, and uniquely Indian—especially Kolkata.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True, true. Now, you’ve got a huge fan following. Has there been a message or a gesture from a fan that truly touched you?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Many. So many, actually. We’ve received love in ways that very few people have.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Would you like to share a couple of those moments?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> One that stays with me—there was a small kid who recognized me and just kept shouting “Foodka! Foodka!” Kids like that, they always melt my heart.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really sweet. There’s something special about that kind of innocent admiration. So, what advice would you give to aspiring food influencers?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Just define why you’re here. That one sentence. Why are you doing what you’re doing? Once that’s clear, you’re sorted.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So essentially—be authentic.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Be authentic to yourself, at least.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And what about trends? Do you believe in them?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Nope. Not really. There are patterns we should adapt to over time, sure. But trends? No, they come and go. Nothing substantial there.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s next for Foodka?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Travel. That’s the single-point agenda. Across India. Across the world. Just travel.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Given that, if you could explore and cover the food culture of one country, which would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Istanbul. That’s the place.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an excellent choice—very rich, diverse food culture. Now here’s a fun one—if you had to describe your life journey so far using one dish, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> A sandwich. You don’t really know what’s gone inside, but it’s tasty anyway.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) So there’s a mystery there.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> There should be. That’s what keeps life interesting.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one life lesson you’ve learned from food?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Timing is everything. That’s the key. You can’t beat time. Everything depends on it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. And what’s one thing about Indrajit Lahiri that people don’t usually know, but would find fascinating?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> There’s nothing hidden anymore. Life is out in the open. In this digital era, there’s no space to hide.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. So, how would you like to be remembered? What’s the legacy you want to leave behind?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Storyteller.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love it. Now, let’s do a quick rapid fire!</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Let’s go for it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word that describes you?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Human.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Describe your life in a hashtag?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> #Mohamushkil. That’s what I use for my blog.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Dream destination you haven’t visited yet?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Mongolia.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Last thing you binge-watched?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Dahaad—on Prime.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you can’t live without?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> My son.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I knew that one. First thing you do when you wake up?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Have some water, settle down, and check the time.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Guilty pleasure?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Let’s not go there—too many.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A superstition you secretly believe in?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> None. I’m an atheist—superstitions don’t work on me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Go-to comfort food?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Biryani.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One person who can always make you laugh?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> My son, Gibbs.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you were a dish, what would your tagline be?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Tasty.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s more difficult—finding the perfect biryani or parallel parking?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Finding the perfect biryani. Parallel parking is so western—we barely even do it here in India.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True that! If your phone battery is at 1%, what’s the last thing you’d do?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Find a charging point. Or just switch it off to reserve it.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You have to pick one—no internet for a week or no food delivery for a week?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> No internet and no food delivery. I’ll survive both.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s more dangerous—a spicy food challenge or reading YouTube comments?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Reading YouTube comments, no doubt.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had to rename Foodka, what would you call it?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> I wouldn’t. It stays Foodka.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could replace all meetings with something else, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Silence. Or maybe sitting by a mountain creek in the sun.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nice. You have 10 seconds to invent a new dish—what’s it called and what’s in it?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> No clue. Ten seconds is too short. Maybe I’ll just call it Gossip—that’s something we can always cook up.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) If life gave you lemons—what would you make? Lemonade, margarita, or just return them?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Lemonade. Something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s perfect. This was such a fun conversation! Is there anything you'd like to add that we missed?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Nothing at all. You did a brilliant job with this interview. I’m genuinely looking forward to watching this episode.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much! We’ll definitely keep you in the loop on everything.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrajit:</strong> Absolutely. Looking forward to it. Bye!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye!</p>
