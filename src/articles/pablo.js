                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome to Global Influencers
                Hub! Here, we talk about the live journeys of social media
                influencers, and today, we are excited to have you. So, let’s
                dive right into your journey! Tell us, where did it all begin
                for you?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Pablo Montana:</strong> Thank you, Devika. My English is
                not very good because my mother tongue is Spanish, but if you
                speak slowly, I can understand and respond better.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! I’ll speak slowly. So, tell
                us about your life journey. Where were you born, and how did it
                all start?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Pablo:</strong> I was born in a small town in Colombia,
                where the main opportunity for people is farming. But at 21
                years old, I left for Panama in search of better opportunities.
                That’s where I found music. I discovered my love for music
                through instruments, and that’s when I started dreaming.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! What kind of music
                spoke to you the most?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Pablo:</strong> I always wanted to create music with a
                good message—something that makes people believe in something
                greater. Growing up in Colombia is hard. Many people struggle
                to find good education and opportunities, so they move to
                different countries. We are a nation of 45 million people with
                immense talent, and we have to fight for our opportunities.
              </p>

                interview for a week. It was an absolute pleasure!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> The pleasure was all ours! Take care,
                and we’ll be in touch.
              </p>
