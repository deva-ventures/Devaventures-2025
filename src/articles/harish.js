              <p>
             
              Harish Closepet, a celebrated chef and entrepreneur, recently shared his remarkable journey in an insightful conversation with Devika Majumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub. From his inquisitive childhood, where he set up his own chemistry lab in a cupboard, to becoming a MasterChef finalist, Harish delves into the defining moments that shaped his passion for food. His story is one of creativity, perseverance, and an unyielding drive to innovate in the culinary space. Here’s an exclusive look at his inspiring journey.


              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Harish, it's such a pleasure to have you here! Let’s start from the very beginning—what was little Harish like as a child?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish Closepet:</strong> I was always very inquisitive! In fact, at home, I had my own little chemistry lab in a small cupboard where I would mix chemicals just to see their reactions. That curiosity extended to food as well. I was fascinated by how ingredients reacted with each other.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow! That’s quite something. So, do you think that early curiosity influenced your approach to cooking?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Absolutely! Even today, when I cook, I rarely try a dish before filming. Most of my dishes are created straight in front of the camera. I understand the chemistry of food, and that’s what makes the process exciting for me.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! So when did this passion truly take form? When did you start experimenting with food?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> I think it really started when I was in Class 5 or 6. My parents would take their afternoon nap, and I’d sneak into the kitchen to try out new things. My job back then was to blow the charcoal to keep the firewood burning while my mother cooked. That’s where I think I picked up a lot of my skills.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a vivid memory! Do you have a favorite food memory from childhood?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Oh yes! My mom’s gulab jamuns. I absolutely loved them! I would sneak into the kitchen and eat 10 to 20 of them at a time when no one was around. In terms of savory dishes, my favorite was poha bisibele bath. Those flavors are deeply ingrained in my memory.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Was your mother your biggest influence when it came to cooking?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Yes, without a doubt! My mom never measured ingredients; she just knew the right proportions instinctively. I think I inherited that from her. Even today, I don’t measure—cooking for me is all about intuition and experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so interesting. When did you realize that food was more than just a hobby for you?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> It was when I started making lunch boxes for my daughter, Viba, around the year 2000. At first, she didn’t like the usual packed lunches, and I realized she was throwing them away—sometimes even hiding them under the sofa! That’s when I decided to get creative and make her meals visually appealing and exciting.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my! That must have been quite the realization. What did you do differently?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> I started incorporating different cuisines, flavors, and presentations into her lunch boxes. I made different types of pasta, rice dishes, and rolls to keep her interested. Eventually, she looked forward to her lunch breaks and even shared her meals with friends. That was a turning point for me.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And how did this lunchbox journey evolve over time?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> When my second daughter, Isha, was born eight years later, I found myself making two different lunchboxes because both had different preferences. Once they both grew out of school, Isha suggested we share my lunchbox ideas on Instagram. That’s how ‘Harry’s Lunchbox’ was born!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a fantastic story! What’s the story behind the name ‘Harry’s Lunchbox’?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> It actually started when I worked in Australia as a confectionery buyer. I came up with a concept of mini candy packs that could be added to lunchboxes, and since everyone in Australia called me Harry, I named it ‘Harry’s Lunchbox.’ Though that idea didn’t take off back then, I reused the name for my Instagram page, and it stuck!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a great connection! Now, well, how did MasterChef happen? Talk to us about that.</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Well, yeah. When we put out this reel, we got an amazing response. People started thanking us—it was the first reel, and people began to say, "Hey, this is very convenient. We can just see the reel and prepare lunch." So, we continued. I also run a business, I don’t know whether you're aware. It’s called Itsy Bitsy.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, yes. We did see that. We were going to talk to you about that as well.</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> So, I was quite busy, and I could only put out one reel a week or probably one every two weeks. But still, people started giving really good comments and liking what I was doing. Both my daughters, though they go to work, I occasionally pack lunch for them. And that became the day when, whenever I packed lunch, I would do a reel—at least once a week.</p>

            <p>One day, we were sitting at home, and my older daughter said, "Why don’t you apply for MasterChef?" Then my younger daughter, Isha—who is the architect of my page, handling all the shoots, edits, and direction—said, "Dad, you must go!" I hesitated, thinking, "If I get selected, I have to be away for a couple of months. How does that work?"</p>

            <p>They convinced me. So, I applied online, went to the auditions, and cleared all four rounds. I myself was surprised!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing!</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Yes, we often surprise ourselves. That’s a good thing. Then, I was in the Top 12, and that’s where the journey started. It was just an amazing experience.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Talk to us a little more about the emotional and physical aspects. What was going on behind the scenes?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> MasterChef, as you know, is a reality show, so there are a lot of emotions involved. It's a competition—you have to be aggressive. I’m very aggressive in my business, but when it came to MasterChef, I wasn’t as aggressive. I wanted to make it an enjoyable process for myself. It was not about winning so much for me; I just wanted to put my best dish forward.</p>

            <p>I was away from home for about three months with no notice. I must say, my wife Rashmi managed the business so well in my absence that, in fact, it grew faster than when I was running it. So, I must thank her!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How sweet! Very nice.</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> As a season, we were one of the most united groups. That doesn’t always make for the most dramatic reality TV, but we supported each other a lot. Even today, the entire Top 12 remains very close. We hang out whenever we get the chance. The show gave us lifelong friends.</p>

            <p>Of course, it also made us more precise in terms of plating, flavor enhancement, and presentation. While we might not be professional chefs, I’d say we are now about 30% closer to that level than when we started. We focused so much on the art of presentation that we earned extra points there.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! What’s one thing about being a chef that people don’t realize?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> I believe that when you give to the world, you receive happiness in return. Being a chef is about constantly giving beautiful creations to people. The satisfaction people get from eating your food is immense—it’s immeasurable.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! That’s a beautiful thought. What’s one key lesson that has stayed with you from your MasterChef days?</p>
            <p><strong>Harish:</strong> One lesson is that age is never a barrier for any adventure. I never thought about how old I was—I just stepped in. Physically, it was tiring for some contestants, but not for me. My mind was stronger than my body. I could stand for 12-14 hours a day without a wince. If your mind is strong, you can achieve anything. Also, if I relate cooking to life—if you have the right ingredients, life will be as sweet as the best dish you can make.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! That’s a beautiful message. Now, food trends come and go. What’s one trend you think should make a comeback?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Recently, I visited a restaurant that brought back very traditional South Indian dishes—recipes from our grandmothers’ and mothers’ times that are not commonly found in restaurants anymore.</p>
      <p>I see a trend where restaurants are taking old recipes, giving them a new look, and presenting them in a modern way—sometimes even renaming them and serving them at premium prices. Our forefathers have created so much culinary richness; we don’t always need to reinvent. Instead, we can reintroduce these forgotten recipes in a contemporary way.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so true! Forgotten recipes deserve a comeback. If you had to create a dish that represents your life, what would it be?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> I actually did that on MasterChef! My "Watermelon Rice" dish represented my life. Watermelon is sweet, but I added savory elements to it, elevating the fruitiness while also incorporating fried bitter gourd, representing the ups and downs of life.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! What would you call it?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> "The Journey of My Life."</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great name! Now, what’s the signature dish of "Harry’s Lunchbox"?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> I personally love making pastas, but my viewers seem to love my paniyarams the most. I can make 20 different varieties of them! Have you tried paniyarams?</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> No, I haven’t!</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> They are like small, round, savory dumplings made from fermented batter. They’re very tasty—you must try them!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I will! Now, is there an emotional connection to any dish that holds a special place in your heart?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> My mom’s rasam, made in a stone vessel over firewood, brings back the strongest emotions. That taste was just incredible. I’ve tried recreating it in a stone pot over a gas flame, and it still tastes amazing.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. So, Harish, let’s talk a little bit about your toughest critics. Who are they?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Well, before I went to MasterChef, my whole family were my critics. But now, I’ve polished my skills on my own. My daughters, though, they’re always straightforward with me. They tell me exactly what they feel. If something isn’t up to their mark, they won’t hesitate to say, “Daddy, this is not good,” and might give it just a 4 out of 10. They’re both honest, and I appreciate that.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so wonderful! Now, if you were to expand Harry’s Lunchbox anywhere in the world, where would you take it next?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Right now, my focus is on providing solutions for people who want to pack lunchboxes. There’s been a lot of demand for toddler recipes, so I’m diving deep into that research. As for expansion, while I’m not limiting myself to India, I’m more interested in helping people globally. I’ve seen gyms in the U.S. using my lunchbox recipes, and many in Australia have started following my page too. But for now, I’m going to focus on this for at least another three years before exploring any new directions.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You’ve got your hands full! Tell us about your venture, Itsy Bitsy. What’s the story behind that?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish Closepet:</strong> My wife and I lived in Australia for a while, and in 2004, we decided to move back to India and start a women-empowering business, employing rural women. We trained 20 women to make paper flowers, which we learned to craft in Thailand. Our first customer was in the U.S., and soon, our flowers were being sold in stores like Michael’s and Hobby Lobby. Now, we’re the world’s largest paper flower manufacturer, with over 3,000 women working with us directly or indirectly. It’s been a wonderful journey.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! You’ve truly made a difference. How do you manage Itsy Bitsy, your lunchbox project, and your personal life?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Touch wood, both our kids are very balanced and independent. That helps a lot! We also have a fantastic team at Itsy Bitsy with low attrition rates, and we’ve built a strong, well-oiled machine. This ensures that we don’t face serious challenges in managing everything. I’m not looking at expanding Itsy Bitsy in a new direction just yet, but we’re planning to expand with CBDC in the next financial year.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It sounds like everything’s running like clockwork! Now, have you ever considered writing a cookbook?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> A lot of people have asked me that. I’m thinking of releasing one by the end of next year, but I want it to be different. It won’t be just another cookbook. I’m aiming for something unique, possibly interactive. I’m still brainstorming ideas.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds exciting! What advice would you give to aspiring chefs?</p>
      <p><strong>Harish:</strong> Many chefs get a lot of training, working in big hotels and restaurants. But the problem I see is that they often lose their creativity. If you go to 10 five-star hotels, the breakfast buffet looks identical. Innovation goes out the window. I always tell chefs to work in smaller restaurants where they have the freedom to experiment and innovate. It’s about applying your skills creatively. Don’t get stuck in the corporate grind, where everything’s about P&amp;L. Try to be creative, take risks, and maybe even start your own small restaurant.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! It’s all about staying true to your creativity. Let’s have some fun now with a rapid-fire round!</p>
