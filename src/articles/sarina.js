          Sarina Pani, a passionate fitness coach and professional athlete, recently sat down for an insightful conversation with Devika Majumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub. Sarina's journey is one of perseverance, self-discovery, and breaking societal norms. From working in IT for over seven years to becoming a Zumba instructor, and eventually making her mark as an IFBB Pro Bikini Athlete, her story is a testament to the power of resilience and self-belief. In this engaging discussion, she delves into the pivotal moments of her journey, the challenges she faced, and the mindset that helped her push through barriers. Here’s a glimpse into their conversation:
          </p>
       
          <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sarina. Welcome! We’re here to talk about the life journeys of social media influencers. What was that defining moment when you realized fitness was your true calling?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina Pani:</strong> It wasn’t something I actively sought out at first. I come from Odisha, where the conventional path for a girl is to study, get a job, get married, and settle down. But I always had a keen interest in dancing and yoga. Things changed when my husband—then my boyfriend—fell seriously ill due to an unhealthy lifestyle. That became my wake-up call, and I decided to become a Zumba instructor, blending passion with purpose. It transformed my life.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! From there, you went on to win Fit Factor in India and make a mark as a female athlete. Tell us more.</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I worked in IT for 7.5 years while teaching Zumba. By 2015-2016, I earned enough from group classes to take a sabbatical. Then COVID hit, shutting down gyms. I built a home gym, trained via YouTube, and in 2021 a coach encouraged me to compete. I won Fit Factor Beachbody, became an IFBB Pro, and now represent India globally in bikini bodybuilding.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. What’s your current goal?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Competing in pro shows as an Olympia qualifier. No Indian female has made it yet—I want to be the first.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What was your biggest obstacle?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> The attire. Coming from a traditional background, wearing a bikini on stage was mentally challenging. Overcoming that was harder than physical training, but I learned confidence comes from within.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Did you meditate during training?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> For me, working out is meditation. I train alone to build independence—COVID taught me I couldn’t rely on others for my fitness.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Many people need workout buddies for motivation. Your advice?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Build internal drive. No one can do the work for you. Training alone built my discipline and resilience.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What was your nutrition plan?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> High-protein diet, very low carbs toward competition. I ensured 9 hours of sleep. Fitness became my most loyal companion.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> How do you stay authentic in the noisy fitness industry?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Continuous learning. Updating my certifications every 6 months ensures I provide factual, not clickbait, content.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> How important is mental fitness?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> It’s everything. Without mental strength, physical challenges are impossible to overcome. I’ve also embraced spirituality, meditating daily and attending kirtan on weekends.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Was there a moment that really tested your mental strength?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Yes—low-calorie prep cravings. I once cried over pani puri! I learned to divert my mind to cleaning or organizing instead.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I’m sure your husband appreciates the clean house!</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> He does!</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What does having a ‘beach body’ mean to you?</p>

<p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Confidence. Every body is a beach body. I overcame my hesitation by wearing a bikini in Goa, realizing it’s just clothing. Now I encourage others to wear what makes them feel good and own it.</p>
          
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful way to look at it! As a fitness coach, what’s your favourite type of workout to teach?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I always vouch for weight training. While I do incorporate flexibility, agility, and mobility drills for a holistic approach, weight training is my personal favourite. I’ve seen firsthand how it has transformed my body...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you coach online as well?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Yes! Fitter is a completely online platform, so all my coaching is virtual.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! Could you tell us more about Fitter? If someone listening to this interview wants to become a coach, how can they do that?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> To become a coach at Fitter, you need to complete the INFS diploma course...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like an incredible journey in itself! Now, what’s one thing that people often get wrong about fitness?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> People try to do too much at once. They overload themselves with unrealistic expectations...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes so much sense! Now, I have a personal question—consistency is my biggest struggle...</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> That’s actually the most common problem people face! The key is to find a rhythm...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What is the mantra of consistency when it comes to fitness?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> First, you have to understand how your mind works...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a fantastic strategy! Now, if I were to follow you around for a day, what would your daily routine look like?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> My day starts with two or three black coffees before I even open my eyes...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your favorite cheat meal?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I actually don’t do cheat meals because I’ve incorporated my favorite foods into my diet...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great approach! Do you prefer homemade food over eating out?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Yes, I prefer homemade food because I control the ingredients and calories...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s interesting! Do you have a dream destination for fitness workouts?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I would love to go to Dubai!...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever faced a crazy fitness challenge while traveling?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Not while traveling, but once at home, I locked myself out...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s hilarious! What does your perfect rest day look like?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> My rest days involve watching my favorite movies...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever received any weird requests from clients?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> All the time!...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Speaking of myths, what’s one fitness myth that drives you crazy?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> The idea that you can spot-reduce fat...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s unfortunate but true. If you weren’t a fitness coach, what would you be doing?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I’d probably still be in my IT job...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever had an embarrassing moment at the gym?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Yes! Once, I wore tight leggings for leg day...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s dedication! What’s your go-to workout if you only have 15 minutes?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I’d do a high-intensity interval training...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could train a celebrity, who would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I’d love to train Vidyut Jammwal!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one fitness challenge you haven’t conquered yet but want to?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> A handstand!...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lastly, what advice would you give to fitness beginners?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Just keep going...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sarina, is there anything else you’d like to share about your life?</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> I’ve always had this belief that I was meant for something bigger...</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! That’s how the universe works sometimes...</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Yes, absolutely!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful!</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> That means a lot to me! Thank you so much.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you for sharing your story, Sarina. I look forward to staying connected!</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Anytime! Thanks again.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye!</p>
              <p><strong>Sarina:</strong> Bye-bye!</p>
