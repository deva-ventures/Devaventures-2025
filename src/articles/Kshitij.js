              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome to Global Influencers Hub! Here, we explore the inspiring journeys of influencers, and today, we’re thrilled to dive into yours. We’d love to hear about your experiences—your challenges, successes, and everything in between. Let’s start from the very beginning.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij Sheetak:</strong> Thank you for having me! It’s truly a pleasure to be here. I must say, I’m really impressed with what you’re doing. There are very few platforms dedicated to highlighting the journeys of influencers in such a meaningful way. It’s refreshing to see something that genuinely puts influencers at the forefront.
              </p>

              <p>
                Growing up, my childhood was quite typical. I was an average student—not particularly outgoing. In fact, one of my schoolteachers once told my mother, “He’s not a creative child. Don’t push him towards anything creative. Guide him toward finance or science instead.” But ironically, I wasn’t great at science either, so that wasn’t an option for me.
              </p>

              <p>
                Until my 12th grade, I struggled with public speaking. I couldn’t even stand in front of ten people and talk. But everything changed in college. That’s when I started doing presentations, and slowly, I began to find my voice. That was the turning point. I developed an interest in marketing, pursued it further, and eventually completed my MBA in Australia. From then on, my journey in marketing took off.
              </p>

              <p>
                It might sound like an average journey, but it has certainly been an interesting one!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic! No, no—there’s no such thing as an ‘average journey.’ Every path is unique, and yours is truly inspiring. So, let’s talk about that transition—from doing an MBA in Australia to founding ShootGuru. How did that happen?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Well, while pursuing my MBA in Australia, I worked with an agency called Inbound Marketing Australia. Over time, I transitioned from one job to another—starting with credit card sales, then moving into sales, and eventually returning to marketing. I became an Assistant Marketing Manager for a company in Australia, where my primary role was to initiate celebrity campaigns. I was responsible for hiring photographers and creative directors, essentially managing the agency side of things.
              </p>

              <p>
                But I was always curious. I would often borrow my friends' cameras or use my own small camera to capture behind-the-scenes moments from our shoots. One day, during a particular shoot, I kept giving so many suggestions to the photographer that I think I annoyed him. Frustrated, he handed me the camera and said, "Here, shoot it yourself." So, I did. To my surprise, some of my shots got selected!
              </p>

              <p>
                That photographer was Mike Moody, a highly respected professional in the field. I later apologized for overstepping, but instead of being upset, he took me under his wing. I learned a great deal from him. Sadly, Mike passed away a few years ago, but his mentorship played a huge role in shaping my passion for photography.
              </p>

              <p>
                By February 2008, I moved back to India due to family reasons. However, I quickly realized that the Indian market wasn’t ready for marketing professionals—it was all about sales. And I didn’t want to go back into sales.
              </p>

              <p>
                I briefly joined my dad’s business, but it didn’t excite me—it was already well-established, and I found it too monotonous. During this time, I started visiting ISKCON and became actively involved in its theater group. Through this, I was exposed to a whole new cultural world.
              </p>

              <p>
                One day, we decided to make a short film. I thought, "Why not?" So, in February 2009, with no formal training—just the experience I had gained in Australia and from working with filmmakers—I made my first short film. It took us nearly a year to complete since everyone involved was collaborating in their free time. But that experience marked the true beginning of my journey into filmmaking.
              </p>

              <p>
                ShootGuru only came into existence in February 2017 when I realized that basic education in film and photography was still lacking in India. When we hired creators, we often noticed gaps in their fundamental knowledge. We felt that aspiring filmmakers and photographers were missing out on crucial aspects of the craft.
              </p>

              <p>
                That’s when we decided to take action. Our philosophy has always been that basic education in film and photography should be either free or at least affordable. That’s how ShootGuru was born.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic! It sounds like this was truly your calling. Was there a specific moment when you realized this was what you wanted to do, or was it more of a gradual process?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> More than anything, it was a process. I didn’t have a single ‘aha’ moment—it was a series of experiences that led me here. I found myself at a crossroads. I had nothing else that truly excited me. I had worked in the corporate world in Australia, but when I returned to India, I didn’t fit into the corporate culture here.
              </p>

              <p>
                Filmmaking, on the other hand, felt right. I realized that this was what I wanted to do—not only because I wanted to be my own boss, but also because I had always been a tech enthusiast. That technical side of me pushed me further into the world of film and photography. The more I explored, the more I knew that this was my true passion.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, very cool! Now, as a cinematographer, how do you approach a new project?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> See, more than just a cinematographer, I look at projects as full-fledged productions. If I were to approach a project only as a cinematographer, my involvement would be much more limited—I’d contribute during pre-production, be active during production, and then step away once post-production begins.
              </p>

              <p>
                But when I take on a project as a producer, I get the opportunity to be involved in every stage, from concept to execution. The first thing we ask any client is, "What do you need this for? Why are you getting it done?" So often, there’s a gap between what they think they want and what they actually need.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Right, the emotion behind it?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> More than just the emotion—it’s about the usage as well.
                What is the purpose of the content? Who is the audience? What is the use-case scenario? 
                Surprisingly, 99% of brands struggle to answer these questions because their vision doesn’t 
                always align with the brief they provide.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Being an MBA in marketing gives me an edge—I can ask these 
                strategic questions and then seamlessly transition into my role as a cinematographer and 
                producer. That way, we ensure that we’re delivering exactly what the client needs, rather 
                than just executing a concept that might not serve their intended goals.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, you take a holistic approach to a brand?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, basically.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That is wonderful, and that is absolutely a unique selling point.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yep.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. So, what do you think is one of the biggest misconceptions 
                people have about the space you’re in?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> The biggest misconception is that anybody can shoot. People buy a 
                camera and immediately think, “Okay, I’m a cinematographer now.” The same goes for expensive 
                smartphones—people believe that having a high-end phone makes them capable cinematographers. 
                But what they fail to realize is that there’s a process, a craft, and a skill set required.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> To execute any type of shoot—whether photography or filmmaking—you 
                need to have a fundamental understanding of the basics. If you don’t grasp those core 
                principles, you’re bound to make mistakes. That’s why we often see creators who start projects 
                with enthusiasm, invest in equipment, build a team, and then suddenly stop. It’s not because 
                they lack passion but because they encounter challenges they weren’t prepared for. These 
                roadblocks arise due to a lack of foundational knowledge, and 99% of the time, that’s what 
                leads to their struggles.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay. And that is a very fundamental issue with our education system 
                when it comes to film and photography. The basics being taught are at least ten years old. The 
                market has evolved, and the dynamics have shifted. There are very few schools across India 
                that actually teach the latest technology. Most students graduating from these programs are 
                still using outdated techniques, making them almost prehistoric in terms of industry relevance.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> As a result, they waste a lot of time unlearning old methods before 
                they can even begin learning what’s relevant today. That’s a huge problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Exactly.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Now, you are self-taught, correct?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Tell us about the process of self-teaching that you went through.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> I come from an era where there was nothing available online—no YouTube 
                tutorials, no online classes, nothing. If you wanted to learn offline, you couldn’t just go 
                and assist senior professionals unless you had personal connections. Unless they were your 
                relatives or close friends, they wouldn’t help you. The industry is structured in a way where 
                everyone sees newcomers as competition, making it incredibly difficult to break in.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> For me, gaining basic knowledge was the hardest part. Since I already 
                had an MBA, my parents told me they wouldn’t spend any more money on my education. So, I had 
                to figure things out on my own. When I made my first short film, I bought books on filmmaking, 
                spoke to industry professionals, and studied their processes. As a producer and director, I 
                hired experienced people because I wanted to observe and learn from them.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Of course, this came with its challenges. I was overcharged, misled, 
                and wasted both time and money. There were inefficiencies in the process, things I could have 
                skipped, but I had to go through them to truly understand the craft. Eventually, I got into 
                FTII, but the course was scrapped before it even began. Instead, five of us were sent to Mumbai 
                as interns.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> That was my real learning phase. Imagine being 24 years old, an intern 
                in Mumbai, with no connections or mentor to guide you. I had to start from scratch, learning by 
                observation and hands-on experience. Instead of relying on senior directors or cinematographers—
                who only work a limited number of days per year—I learned from the industry’s backbone: lightmen, 
                camera assistants, gaffers, and spot boys. These technicians work 365 days a year, gaining more 
                practical experience than most top-level professionals. By assisting them, I absorbed knowledge 
                at an accelerated pace.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> But the biggest lesson wasn’t technical—it was about letting go of my 
                ego. At 25, I made a huge mistake on set by forgetting to insert a card into the camera. I got 
                slapped in front of 50 people. I had two choices: walk away in anger or stay and learn. I chose 
                the latter. Because of that decision, the same senior who reprimanded me ended up mentoring me 
                for the next three months, and I gained invaluable experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic. That’s a tremendous takeaway for sure. Now, tell us about 
                the different challenges you faced as you moved forward in filmmaking. Of course, what you’ve 
                described so far was challenging, but were there any other significant obstacles along the way?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> The biggest challenge I faced—and one that many people continue to face 
                today—is that I never had a mentor. I never had someone to hold my hand and say, “Listen, what 
                you're doing here is wrong. Here’s a better way to approach it.” Neither in filmmaking nor in 
                the business side of things did I have that kind of guidance.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Because of this, I made a lot of wrong decisions. Just two years into 
                the industry, I took on a feature film project. I wasn’t ready. I had the equipment, I had a 
                small team, but we lacked experience. The only experienced person on set was me, fresh from an 
                internship in Mumbai. I thought, “Wow, I can do this.” But that overconfidence cost us dearly—
                we lost a lot of money.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> We regrouped, reassessed, and got back on our feet. But without 
                guidance, we made the same mistake five years later. This time, I thought, “Now we’re ready. 
                We have more equipment, a more experienced team—we can do it.” But once again, we failed 
                miserably. I was ready, my team was ready, but the people who hired us weren’t.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> These kinds of experiences taught me that without a mentor—someone who 
                has been through failures and can guide you on what to do and what to avoid—you’re bound to stumble. 
                You need an experienced person who can foresee the pitfalls that you, as a newcomer, can’t. 
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> We used to joke that we were like a tea bag—you keep dipping it into hot 
                water, and with every fall, it adds more flavor. We loved what we were doing, but we kept falling. 
                Now, we’ve learned from our mistakes. But looking back, having a mentor could have made a world of 
                difference.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an interesting perspective. I think this holds true for most fields, 
                don’t you agree?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Kshitij:</strong> Absolutely. The process of finding a mentor itself is a massive task. 
                It’s not just about learning from someone experienced—it’s about finding the right person who 
                truly understands your journey.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly. In today's fast-paced world, there seem to be fewer mentors and more influencers or teachers. Would you say that’s the case?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yes, I believe so. Teachers can provide knowledge, and influencers can inspire, but a mentor is different. A true mentor invests in you personally, guiding you through challenges with wisdom drawn from their own struggles.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great distinction. A mentor-mentee relationship is special—it goes beyond mere instruction.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Precisely. A mentor is someone who has already burned their fingers so that you don’t have to. They don’t just tell you what to do; they show you what not to do.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a powerful insight. Learning from mistakes—especially someone else’s—can be invaluable. I heard you're working on a book that explores this very idea?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yes, I am. The book focuses on lessons from my own experiences—things that didn’t go as planned and the invaluable insights they provided. While I might not be able to write a guide on “what to do,” I can definitely write one on “what not to do.”</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, in a way, knowing what not to do ultimately leads to understanding what to do?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Exactly! Every misstep teaches you a lesson that refines your decision-making process.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes perfect sense. Speaking of experiences, have you encountered any particularly challenging collaborations in your career?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Oh, absolutely. One that stands out was a feature film we worked on in 2015 called Narayan. It had a theatrical release and is still available on YouTube. It was a collaboration with a friend, a fantastic story, and everything seemed perfect—except for one major flaw: we didn’t have a script.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> What was originally planned as a 30-day project turned into a 108-day ordeal. Everyone got frustrated, and what should have been completed in three months ended up taking nearly a year. That experience hit hard because it cost us credibility and momentum. The delays impacted team morale, and I learned a valuable lesson: just because I can take on a project doesn’t mean I should.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been a tough realization. Did it change the way you approach projects now?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Completely. Now, I carefully evaluate every opportunity. Another key lesson I learned is that lucrative projects aren’t always the right ones. The money might be great, but if the client’s vision doesn’t align with yours, or if they have a completely different mindset, the project becomes a nightmare.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I’ve taken on high-paying projects before that left me feeling unfulfilled. The stress and frustration just weren’t worth it. Now, I take the time to analyze and break down every project before committing. It’s crucial to ensure that it aligns with your values and creative process before jumping in.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So the takeaway is to think things through thoroughly before making a decision?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Exactly. Careful evaluation is key. Always look beyond the surface, understand the full scope of what you're taking on, and then execute with confidence. Also, it's essential to protect your personal brand—don’t just give it away carelessly.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great point. Your personal brand is your identity, and it’s crucial to maintain its integrity. Now, shifting gears a little—tell us about your journey in nurturing aspiring filmmakers and photographers.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Sure! So, Shur Guru was founded because we identified a gap in the industry. There’s a disconnect between what people are learning and what’s actually happening in the professional world. When we would hire creators—whether photographers, cinematographers, or content creators—we often encountered fundamental mistakes in their work. These weren’t minor errors; they were basic flaws that shouldn’t exist if someone claims to be a professional.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> That’s why we wanted to guide aspiring creators, giving them the skills they need to match global standards. More importantly, we focus on providing practical exposure. In this industry, if you don’t have hands-on experience, you’re at a huge disadvantage. Sure, you can learn theory from YouTube, Udemy, or online courses, but none of them put a camera in your hand. None of them let you actually fly a drone in real-world conditions.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> When you’re handling equipment worth 1.5 lakh rupees, the anxiety of making a mistake is real. No online course can prepare you for that. That’s why our focus has always been on immersive, hands-on learning—whether it’s for individuals, freelancers, corporate professionals, or business owners. The goal is to help them create high-quality content without unnecessary mistakes, bringing their skills up to international standards.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an incredible mission. Giving people access to real-world tools and experience is invaluable.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Absolutely! The more exposure they get, the better they become. It’s all about refining their craft and equipping them with the confidence to execute their ideas at a professional level.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love the fact that you have a global approach. As soon as you mentioned the international aspect, it really struck a chord. It’s so important because you never know where opportunities might arise—whether locally or somewhere across the world.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Absolutely. That’s the key.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! Can you share some success stories from Shootguru?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Oh, there have been quite a few! Many of my students have gone on to establish their own businesses, whether as successful freelancers or by starting their own production houses. But if I had to highlight one story, it would be about a few students who are now working with me.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> A few years ago, we conducted a boot camp at a college in a small village near Gurgaon, Haryana. We started with a hundred students, all eager to learn content creation. By the end of the program, 40 students had completed the full training. Out of those, 20 actively applied for jobs, and five secured positions. Three of them stayed with us and have since become integral members of our team.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> These were kids who had never even touched a camera before. Today, they can shoot an entire short film on their own. They’ve mastered drone technology, produce high-quality podcasts, shoot travel films, and create compelling visual content. Some of them have even had the opportunity to work on international projects.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> But beyond their technical skills, what truly sets them apart is their mindset. They’re not just absorbing knowledge—they’re applying it. They approach every project with dedication and a willingness to learn. And that’s why they stand out.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring! Now, how long did it take for them to go from not knowing how to hold a camera to actually shooting a short film?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Less than eight months.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! That’s great. And now, they’ve been able to pursue a career in this field. The message to our audience is clear—anyone thinking about a career in photography or cinematography can reach out to Shootguru. In just eight months, they could be well on their way.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Exactly! You don’t need anything more than that. It’s all about practice.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You also provide internship opportunities, right? Can you tell us a bit about that?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yes, we offer training programs. We take students through the entire process, from learning the basics to executing full projects. Like I said, it’s all about practice.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> The more you practice, the more you develop your skills—whether it’s writing, handling a camera, operating a gimbal, flying a drone, editing, or even directing. The key is to keep practicing. The more you practice, the better you perform and the stronger you become in your craft.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> If you give me six months of dedicated effort, I can ensure that you become an independent professional in this field. That’s the whole idea.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very good! That’s truly empowering.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what do you think is the most essential skill for an aspiring filmmaker to develop early in their career?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I would say the ability to continuously learn. Technology evolves every minute, and if you’re not up to date—especially in the technical side of filmmaking and photography—you can’t perform at your best. Staying at par with industry standards requires constant exposure to new advancements.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Absolutely. You need the ability to unlearn and relearn. Every few months, you should be upgrading your skills. That’s the only way to stay ahead.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important perspective, not just for filmmaking but for life in general.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Exactly.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could collaborate with any filmmaker or artist, past or present, who would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I would love to work with Anurag Kashyap.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, interesting!</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, his style of filmmaking is something I really admire. Maybe one day, I’ll create something in his style—not necessarily in the dark genre he’s known for, but with a similar artistic approach.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Maybe someday!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! If you weren’t shooting, what do you think you’d be doing?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I’d be a chef. I love cooking!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! So, tell us about some of your hobbies.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> My core hobby has become my passion. I used to love cameras, filmmaking, and photography—and that’s exactly what I do now. But aside from that, I also love traveling. I collaborate with tourism boards worldwide to create travel-based content. And, of course, I love cooking. Even though I’m vegetarian, I experiment with plant-based alternatives. I consider myself a “non-vegetarian vegetarian”—I miss the flavors of meat and enjoy finding creative plant-based substitutes. One of my specialties is barbecue. My friends and family know me for it, and every year, around Christmas and New Year's, we host barbecue nights.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds fantastic! What kind of barbecue do you do?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> We do vegan barbecues. We use plant-based meats, vegan sausages, and kebabs—no typical soy products, but rather, unique plant-based textured meats. We also grill a variety of vegetables like broccoli and other fresh produce. There’s a huge variety in vegetarian food—it’s not just for meat-eaters!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, of course!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Your approach to vegetarian cuisine is interesting—you provide an opportunity for meat-eaters to come to your barbecues and still enjoy the vegetarian dishes you serve. That’s quite an inclusive approach!</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yes, absolutely! I like creating an environment where everyone can enjoy good food, regardless of their dietary preferences.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That was more of a personal curiosity for me. I consider myself a selective vegetarian—some weeks, I completely avoid meat, while other times, I might indulge. So, I find it fascinating when people successfully merge both worlds.</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> There are plenty of options! You don’t necessarily have to compromise on taste or variety just because you’re eating vegetarian.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! I love vegetarian food too, but I do get tempted by meat sometimes. Now, after a long and exhausting day on set, how do you unwind?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Most of the time, I cook. But apart from that, I love gaming. If you could see my setup here, you'd notice a huge collection of consoles and accessories behind me. This is my game room—my lounge.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing!</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, I’ve built a substantial collection of retro consoles over the years. Playing classic games takes me back to my childhood, and that nostalgia is really comforting.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense—gaming can be a great way to disconnect from the stress of the day. Now, if you could direct a film about your own life, what genre would it be? And who would play you?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> That’s a tough one! I have no idea who would play me, but the genre would definitely be a dark comedy.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, alright. And what’s next for you? What’s next for Shudguru?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I’m releasing a book, like I said. It’s called Learn from My Mistakes.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Congratulations!</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Thank you!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love the title! When is it coming out?</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> It should be out in February. It’s an eBook, mostly a guideline for upcoming filmmakers and photographers—things not to do. The book will also be accompanied by a video interview where I talk about every single aspect covered in it.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds fantastic!</p>
              <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Other than that, we are working on a web series, which should go on the floor by March or April. This month, we’re also working on a couple of short films and documentary projects. There’s a lot happening—documentaries, commercials—it’s a packed schedule!</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful! It sounds like you’re going to be incredibly busy.</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Of course! But at the same time, when your passion and profession merge, it doesn’t feel like work.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful journey for sure.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s do some rapid fire!</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Sure, sure.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite film of all time?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> The Grand Budapest Hotel.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One filmmaking tool you can’t live without?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> My phone.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> The most challenging shoot you’ve ever done in one word?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> A pain-in-the-butt client!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’ll take that! Shoots are fun, but clients can be tough. If you could switch careers for a day, what would you choose?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> A full-time traveler.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow! But you already travel, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, but for work. I want to travel just to travel.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Makes sense! One piece of advice you wish you’d received when you started filmmaking?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Manage your money well. Filmmakers are often bad at financial management, and I learned that the hard way.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s solid advice! Money management is crucial for everyone, not just filmmakers. Now, do you guys take sponsors?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, sometimes. But it’s not always easy.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, nothing is that easy, especially in a creative field like yours. Now, which film genre do you love but would never direct?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Comedy.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Really?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Yeah, it’s the hardest to direct.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Who’s your filmmaking idol?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Anurag Kashyap.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Biggest pet peeve on set?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> People standing around doing nothing!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True! That applies to anything. What’s your secret to staying calm under pressure during shoots?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Chanting. I start my day by chanting and expressing gratitude.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Would you rather shoot a big-budget blockbuster or a small indie film?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> A small indie film.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your go-to song or playlist before a shoot?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Jazz. It helps me focus and set the mood.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Would you rather film an intense action scene or an emotional, quiet moment?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> An emotional, quiet moment.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the most bizarre request you’ve received from a client or director?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Some actors have demanded specific, hard-to-find food on set in places where it’s nearly impossible to get!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! Now, let’s talk about your social media journey.</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> I started posting on Instagram to share free advice when very few people in India were doing it. I’m not an influencer, just someone who engages with people. I reply to every DM, answer questions, and build real connections. But content creation isn’t my core—production is.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you had any memorable fan moments?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Once, in Frankfurt airport, a security officer recognized me and fast-tracked me through security. He couldn’t take a selfie, but he told me he was a big fan!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! Any others?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> One of my fans, Praveen, started following me when I had just 25,000 followers. He later joined me on a shoot in Mumbai, and now he works with me as a senior editor and DOP!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a full-circle moment. What’s your overall life mantra?</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Stay humble and grateful. Life has a way of reminding you why those things matter.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Gratitude is everything. This was such a great conversation!</p>
            <p><strong>Kshitij:</strong> Pleasure! Let’s stay in touch.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Wishing you all the best!</p>
