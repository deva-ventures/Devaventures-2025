          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          Preetha Athrey, a seasoned marketing expert turned content creator, recently joined DevikaMajumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, for an engaging conversation. From her illustrious career in marketing, including her tenure as CMO of Twitter APAC, to her journey into the world of culinary storytelling, Preetha’s transition is nothing short of inspiring. Her platform, Easy Eats with Preetha, has gained remarkable traction, offering quick, nutritious, and delicious recipes for busy professionals and families. Here’s an excerpt from their conversation:
         </p>
       
          
         <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Preetha, to Global Influencers Hub. 
                Here, we talk about the real journeys of social media influencers and content 
                creators. Today, we are going to talk about your journey. So, let's dive right 
                into it and start with Easy Eats with Preetha. What inspired the name? How did you come about it?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha Athrey:</strong> First and foremost, thank you so much for giving me this opportunity 
                to tell my story. It’s really interesting how this all started—it wasn’t something I planned, it just 
                happened. When I signed off from my last role as CMO of Twitter APAC, I decided to take a sabbatical 
                after working for almost twenty-two years in marketing and sales. I've always had a passion for cooking. 
                It’s not something new—I actually did my hotel management years ago and worked at the Taj before transitioning 
                into a marketing career. Cooking and experimenting with ingredients have always been something I love.
              </p>

              <p>
                By God’s grace, because I come from an armed forces background, I’ve traveled across India and globally as well. 
                Everywhere I go, I love visiting local markets, supermarkets, and farmers' markets to explore local ingredients 
                and experiment with food. My grandmother and mother are both amazing cooks—way better than me, to be honest! 
                I’m still learning.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I took my sabbatical, a lot of people who liked my recipes would ask me to send clips or record how I made them. 
                So, I thought, let me give it a shot. That’s how it started. The name ‘Easy Eats’ comes from the idea that as working 
                professionals, we don’t always have time to plan elaborate meals. We are often crunched for time, but at the same time, 
                we don’t want to order in constantly. Especially if you’re a working mother, you want something that is healthy, tasty, 
                and nutritious, but also quick and easy to make. That’s what Easy Eats is all about. Even if you have just three 
                ingredients in your pantry, you’ll find a recipe on my page that you can whip up. The goal is to make food exciting, 
                interesting, yet simple and easy.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! Like you said, I think working mothers would absolutely love that. 
                Now, let’s rewind a little. Tell us about your childhood and the journey that led you here.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> I come from an armed forces background—my dad was in the Air Force. So, I’ve lived all over 
                India—Bangalore, Bhuj, Ambala, Bagdogra near Darjeeling, and the entire Northeast. My dad was also posted in Shillong, 
                and then we moved back to Chennai and Bangalore. I’ve traveled and lived in so many places.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am South Indian—my parents are from Chennai and Bangalore, and we settled in Bangalore. I’m married to a Punjabi, so 
                it’s a mix of cultures at home. In my professional life, I’ve worked in various places—Bangalore, Mangalore, Mumbai for 
                about eight years, then Delhi, and later Singapore. Having worked in these places and lived there, I got to experience 
                different cuisines firsthand. My love for local cuisine stems from this.
              </p>

              <p>
                I spent twenty-two years in marketing, starting as a marketing manager at Airtel, moving across FMCG, telecom, media, 
                and eventually Twitter, where I was based in Singapore handling APAC marketing. Taking a sabbatical was much needed—it 
                gave me time to focus on my child and rediscover my passion for painting during the COVID years. I spent time doing art, 
                being creative, and making my home just the way I wanted. Then, I stepped into entrepreneurship—I run two organizations 
                now. One focuses on digital and marketing consulting, and the other on creative ventures. So yes, my hands are full, but 
                I’m loving every bit of it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, content creation is a part of your journey along with digital marketing? That’s an amazing combination!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Yes! And let me tell you, it’s still a learning journey. I’ve been in marketing since the days when 
                Google first started. I saw Facebook and Instagram come into the picture much later. I’ve watched this journey from a brand 
                marketing perspective, and now, as a content creator, I see it from a completely different lens. Every day, there’s something 
                new to learn. I’ve had to understand shoots, lighting, cameras, and most importantly, what my audience wants.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding your audience is key. You might think a dish is amazing, but if that’s not what your audience is looking for, 
                it won’t get the engagement you expect. You learn, adapt, and course-correct. And when you work with brands, you have to 
                integrate their messaging in a way that your audience will accept. At the end of the day, you are catering to your audience.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! And that’s why your Instagram is growing so fast. But tell us, has there been a time when you 
                created something, but it didn’t really resonate with your audience?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh yes! You don’t see too many dessert recipes on my page, and that’s because I’m not a dessert person myself. 
                My audience loves my Indian desserts, but my Western desserts don’t do as well. I once made a Valentine’s Day dessert that was delicious, 
                but my audience didn’t engage with it much. They probably preferred going to creators who specialize in baking. That’s when I realized 
                that while people enjoy my content, they come to me specifically for Indian flavors and easy, wholesome meals. So, you learn and adjust 
                accordingly. Chocolate cake, however, is an exception—everyone loves it, so that one did well!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. Now, what is that one dish you’ve perfected, the one that never fails to impress?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Rasam. I have a whole series on rasam because I absolutely love it. Last October, I posted an instant pepper 
                rasam recipe. It was the perfect timing—the weather was changing, and people wanted something warm and soothing. That video exploded, 
                running into millions of views. People really connected with it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another one is instant dosa—I’m a true South Indian in that way! But the key is to only share recipes that I am 100% sure of. 
                If you’re not confident about a dish, your audience won’t be able to replicate it successfully.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And what was the first dish that made you realize, ‘Wow, this is my calling’?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> It goes back a long way—pasta! I love experimenting with pasta. I don’t like heavy sauces, so I prefer simmering 
                homemade tomato sauce for hours. The house smells amazing when it’s cooking. Then, I toss spaghetti in butter with a little garlic, 
                fresh thyme, basil, and Parmesan cheese. It’s always a hit at dinners. It’s easy, quick, and delicious!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing! And I heard your mom makes something that’s an absolute favorite among your friends?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh yes—her idli upma! If my friends know she’s visiting, they immediately request it. It’s simple but magical!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your comfort food on a lazy day when you just don’t feel like cooking?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, I can tell you three things!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Please, please do!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> One is something I think most people love—dal chawal or rasam rice. It’s one of those meals I always enjoy. 
                If it's summer, though, then curd rice becomes my go-to because it’s so refreshing and easy to whip up.
              </p>

              <p>
                If there’s no rice, then I make a cheela, which is even better! It only takes about five to seven minutes to put together.
              </p>

              <p>
                And finally, I really, really love a warm cup of tea. I’m a huge tea drinker.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, same here!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> I have to have my chai, no matter what the weather is. It could be 45 degrees in Delhi, and I’d still be sipping my tea.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I completely understand! It’s all about comfort.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> Exactly! So yeah, these are my three comfort foods. No matter the time of day, I’m always happy to have them.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Now, do you have a go-to taster? Someone who gives you honest feedback? Or does anyone ever veto your recipes?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Preetha:</strong> You won’t believe it, but my son is my most trusted taster! He’s nine years old.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that’s adorable!
              </p>
              <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Yes, and if he finishes his plate, I know the dish was amazing. If he takes just one bite and refuses more, then I know it didn’t pass the test.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an honest way to gauge success!</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Exactly! Kids have no filters when it comes to feedback. My husband has to be a little more diplomatic, my mom too, but my son? He tells it like it is! If he likes it, I know it’s really, really good. He also craves variety and loves spicy food, so he’s always curious about what I’m making, what ingredients I’m using, and whether his favorite flavors are included.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic! So your son is the final judge when it comes to “Lazy Eats with Preetha.”</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Absolutely! He loves checking out what’s being cooked, what the recipe is, and what ingredients are going in. It’s almost like he’s the sous chef!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s adorable! Now, what’s one kitchen gadget you can’t live without?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, that’s easy—my blender!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, a classic choice.</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Yes! It’s such a lifesaver. My blender has a chopper attachment, and while I do enjoy chopping, sometimes I just want to make my life easier. When I’m making something like Chinese food, where everything needs to be finely chopped, it’s an absolute blessing.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Preetha, tell us about your social media journey. How did your marketing background play into it?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> To be honest, it all just started. I firmly believe that if you wait for the perfect plan, you'll never begin. There will always be something to tweak or improve. So, I set a deadline for myself and decided to launch. Before that, I planned a few recipes and shot some content since it was my first time doing this. Even now, I handle everything—shooting, editing, and posting—on my own.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s impressive! So, you don’t have a team?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Not yet! I haven’t reached that stage, and honestly, I’m quite happy creating content in my own messy, experimental way. I think the key is to just start—think, plan, and then go for it. Once you start, you need to experiment a lot. My first few posts were varied—South Indian dishes, puranpoli (which I made for GudiPadwa), soups, Singapore rice noodles, Sindhi curry—you name it. This helped me understand what my audience enjoyed.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great approach! Did you experiment with different formats as well?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Absolutely! I tried voiceovers, no voiceovers, English, Hindi, Hinglish—I even ran polls to see what people preferred. Did they want short and snappy recipes or full ingredient breakdowns? Over time, I got a sense of what worked, but I also like to shake things up. Changing backgrounds, tweaking formats, and keeping things fresh is important because you don’t want your audience to get bored.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. So, you eventually started showing more of yourself on camera?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Yes! Initially, my face was in the first few reels, then I stopped, but I realized that people weren’t just there for the recipes—they were connecting with me. So, I decided to put my personality out there while maintaining personal boundaries on what I share. Social media is all about comfort levels. Some creators share a lot, others don’t, and both approaches are valid. You should never feel pressured to share more than you’re comfortable with.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s very true. Have you ever faced negativity or trolling?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Thankfully, I haven’t had much of that. I think how you handle things makes a difference. Some comments are meant to provoke, but I don’t engage in unnecessary altercations. It’s best to let things go. Also, it’s important to remember that social media is a filtered version of life—not everything is real or needs to be shared.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Authenticity is key. Have you had any special interactions with your followers?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, so many! I get messages from college students, even medical students, telling me that my recipes are lifesavers for them. That really means a lot. I’ve also met followers from the UK who came to India and wanted to meet me. One of them had a marketing background, and we had such a great conversation, exchanging insights.</p>
            <p>Another thing that touches me is when people from different regions thank me for showcasing their cuisine. They feel proud and seen, which is amazing. And then, of course, there are the everyday DMs filled with love and appreciation. That’s what keeps me going—knowing that people find value in what I share. If they weren’t there, none of this would matter.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so inspiring, Preetha! Now, what advice would you give to someone pursuing a path similar to yours?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> First and foremost, find your space and don’t feel pressured by what others are doing. Trends come and go, and while it’s tempting to jump onto every new one, if you constantly follow trends, you don’t build your own story or niche. My advice would be to get comfortable in your space first, establish your foundation, and then expand. Another important aspect is engaging with your followers. If you feel something isn’t working, ask them directly—“Do you see my content? Do you interact with it? What would you like more of?” You’ll be surprised at the insights you receive. I remember during the festive season, everyone was posting party and celebration recipes, but my audience told me they still wanted my regular tiffin-box and office-lunch series. That’s their daily life, and they needed those ideas just as much as the festive ones. Understanding and evolving based on audience feedback is crucial.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What advice would you give to your younger self?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> I’d tell myself, "Why didn’t you do this sooner?" It’s so much fun! I spent too much time overthinking—what would people say? Should I do this? I’d just tell myself to go with the flow and start. That’s something I admire about the younger generation today—they don’t overthink. They just jump in and figure things out as they go. It’s okay to make mistakes; the challenges make the journey exciting.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever had a kitchen disaster while filming content?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, absolutely! I remember making a gravy once, and when I went to blend it, the lid flew off. The mixture splattered everywhere—including on my camera screen and all over my clothes. I had to stop filming, clean up, and somehow salvage the shoot. Another time, I was filming a close-up of a boiling dish, and suddenly it overflowed everywhere! That wasn’t part of the plan at all. These things happen, and you just have to roll with them.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you ever include these bloopers in your content?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Not really! I’m still not entirely comfortable sharing everything. But I do think behind-the-scenes moments can be fun, and I’ve been considering sharing some. It makes the process more relatable and engaging.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If Easy Eats with Preetha were a movie, what would the title be, and who would play you?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> For the title, I’d go with From Marketing to the Kitchen. It’s a reversal of what most people aspire to do—usually, they want to move out of the kitchen into a corporate career, but I went the other way and love it! As for who would play me, I’d love for Vidya Balan to do it. She’s an incredible actress who really gets into the essence of a character. I think she’d bring the right nuances to the role. Also, she’s a foodie, so she’d understand the passion behind it!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If your kitchen could talk, what do you think it would say about you?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> My kitchen would definitely complain about how forcefully I chop things! It would probably say, "Stop chopping with so much energy, I’m getting a backache!" It would also say, "Stop cleaning all the time!" I have this habit of constantly washing my hands, wiping down the counters, and making sure everything is spotless. I know a lot of people resonate with that—when you’re cooking, you just want your space to be clean. But my kitchen probably thinks I’m overdoing it! At the end of the day, though, I believe cooking should be fun. Yes, things get messy, and sometimes you use more utensils than necessary, but that’s part of the creative process. If you lose the joy in it, then what’s the point?</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What has been your most exciting foodie adventure?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, I don’t know if you’re familiar with the various parts of Delhi, but I absolutely love chaat and street food. I can eat it anytime, anywhere, any day of the year. Not the best habit, especially when you have to exercise and then get caught by your trainer.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What do you mean by “get caught”?</p>
            <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Well, when you’re on social media sharing everything you eat, your trainer sees it too! There’s no hiding. But I love food trails, especially in Old Delhi during winter. Now that it’s more accessible, I make it a point to go. I also enjoy sitting in cafes to work rather than staying in an office—it’s about the vibe, the ambiance, and the music that keeps me energized.</p>
            <p>My experiences with street food in places like Old Delhi, Amritsar, and Lucknow have been amazing. It’s not about going to fancy restaurants, but about enjoying the real, local flavors. I was in Jaipur recently, and having piping hot pyaaz kachori with garam chai in the morning—there’s just nothing like it.</p>
            <p>Even globally, street food has a different charm. The hawker markets in Singapore, for example—some of the best food you can find. I’d go out with my team, sit on the streets, and eat from small cartons with chopsticks or forks. I love food trails, and I’d do them all over again in a heartbeat.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! So, what does a typical day in your life look like?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> My day starts really early because my son is an early riser. Mornings are spent getting him ready for school, and I like having that little time with him before I hit the gym or do Pilates. Getting my workout done in the morning is essential, otherwise, laziness takes over.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, my cup of chai—non-negotiable! A large part of my morning is dedicated to client work. During winter, since I prefer shooting with natural light, I adjust my schedule and shoot more in the mornings. I also have client meetings, and I make sure to shoot almost every day. Editing, however, happens late at night, when the house is peaceful, music is on, and I can focus.</p>
                <p>Evenings are all about my son—homework, family time, winding down. But nighttime is my ‘me time’—candles, good lighting, soft music, and my cup of tea while I sit down to edit or brainstorm ideas. It’s my little slice of bliss.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You seem to balance it all so well! As a working mother, how do you manage everything?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Thank you! But I do have off days. Sundays, for example, are usually my downtime unless there’s a client commitment. It’s either a quick lunch out, trying a new place, or just spending time with family. If you don’t take time off, even if you love your work, it can get overwhelming. So, I make sure to carve out that time to be with my loved ones.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, if you were hosting your dream dinner party, who would be on the guest list and what’s on the menu?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> It would be a mix of my closest friends—some RJs, some creators, and some straight-talking marketing professionals. RJs are super candid, while brand and marketing folks can be more measured, so it would make for an interesting combination!</p>
                <p>For food, I love dishes that are easy to make and let people mix and match. I’d have a spread with sauces, dips, chips, garlic bread, and breadsticks. I also like making Indian-style chaat platters. And a big pot of spaghetti with tomato sauce—something simple yet satisfying.</p>
                <p>One of my signature party items is rasam shots! They can be enjoyed as traditional rasam with panipuri or turned into cocktails and mocktails. People love them because they add an interactive, fun element to the evening. When I host, I want to enjoy the company, not be stuck in the kitchen, so I prep everything in advance.</p>
                <p>During Christmas, I especially love setting up a themed table with lights and decor. I also enjoy giving my guests small goodies—it’s just my way of making the evening extra special.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a party I’d love to attend! What’s next for Easy Eats with Preetha?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> I’m experimenting more with regional cuisine, both Indian and global. I love fusion recipes, and people seem to enjoy them too. Just yesterday, I posted spicy roti tacos with lasoon chutney and bhujia on top—super easy but packed with flavor. I want to keep playing with these unique combinations that create magic in every bite.</p>
                <p>My YouTube journey has also just begun, so I want to focus on making more in-depth recipe videos since people have been asking for more step-by-step breakdowns. Another thing I want to bring back is Wicked Weekends, where I used to share mocktail and cocktail recipes—something I couldn’t do much of this year but will definitely revisit next year.</p>
                <p>Right now, winter foods are my biggest focus. There’s just something special about using seasonal produce—amla, saag, and other fresh market finds. I love visiting local mandis, whether for flowers or vegetables, picking up the freshest ingredients, and turning them into something delicious. That process excites me so much!</p>
             
              
              
                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Butter or olive oil?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Olive oil.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One Indian spice that deserves global fame?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Haldi! It’s already well-known, but it deserves even more recognition.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Home cooking or dining out?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Home cooking, for sure!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the first dish you remember cooking as a child?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Tiny adaidosas made with dal—I used to serve them to everyone at home.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Who was your biggest foodie inspiration growing up?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Yan Can Cook and my father—he was an amazing cook!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one dish from your childhood that you still haven’t mastered?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, there are two actually! One is something called rice sieve—it’s a very traditional dish. It’s all about getting the right consistency and making the string hoppers or noodles perfectly. That’s one.</p>
                <p>The second one is my grandmother’s Mysore Pak. And believe me, it just melts in your mouth—it’s amazing. Even now, in her nineties, she still makes it, and no one in our house has been able to replicate it. It’s that special touch, you know? And asking her for measurements is impossible because she just instinctively knows how much to add.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! Now, what’s your go-to midnight snack?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> I’m trying to cut down on midnight snacking, but I do enjoy a cup of tea—green tea or jasmine tea. But if I’m craving something, I have this weird but delicious combination. Toast with a bit of malai from the fridge and a drizzle of honey on top—that’s my sweet version. And if I want something spicy, I take toast, add a slice of cheese, some bhujia, chopped onions, and maybe a bit of Sriracha or chili sauce. It’s simple but so good! I try to stay out of the kitchen at night, but sometimes cravings win.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sweet tooth or spicy cravings?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Spicy, for sure!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Coriander—love it or leave it?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Oh, love it! Totally.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had one last meal on Earth, what would be on your plate?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Rasam chawal with fried baby potatoes. Simple, comforting, and full of flavor.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One ingredient you can’t live without?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Black pepper.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Cooking in pajamas or full glam for the camera?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> It depends, but usually, you’ll see me in full glam—I love it!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Dream collaboration—chef or celebrity?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Definitely a chef! If I had to pick one, it would be Sanjeev Kapoor. I grew up watching him, and it would be incredible to collaborate with him.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If your kitchen had a theme song, what would it be?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> This is going to sound funny, but have you heard the song Tomato, Tomato? It popped into my head because tomatoes are in almost all my dishes. It’s such a fun song!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I’m going to look that up! Now, is there a food trend you secretly think is overrated?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> People might hate me for this, but I think momos in soup are overrated. I prefer the reverse—like Din Tai Fung’s xiao long bao, where the soup is inside the dumpling instead of being poured over. That’s a technique that’s out of this world!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had to rename Easy Eats with Preetha, what would you call it?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Honestly, I love the name! It just fits so well, and I never felt the need to change it.</p>
              

        
                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! It was such a pleasure talking to you, Preetha. Do you feel like we missed anything?</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> No, this was a wonderful, free-flowing conversation. Talking about life as a creator, I truly believe that enjoying the journey is the most important part. If you’re only focused on numbers, it can get stressful. Of course, I check my numbers too, but if that becomes the sole purpose, it takes away the joy of creating.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! And I love how much you laugh—it makes everything so much more fun.</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> Thank you! Positivity is key. Everyone has challenges, but you just have to keep looking forward. That’s what keeps me going.</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a wonderful mindset. We’ll be reaching out for some photos and recipes for the website and YouTube channel. If you’d like to create something exclusive for Global Influencers Hub, we’d love to feature it!</p>
                <p><strong>Preetha:</strong> That sounds great! I’ll think about it and get back to you. It’s been such a pleasure chatting with you!</p>

                <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Likewise! Thank you so much, Preetha!</p>
