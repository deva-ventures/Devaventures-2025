              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sadaf. Welcome to Global Influencers Hub! Here, we explore the life journeys of social media influencers. Let’s dive into yours. Your username, ‘Traveling Muser,’ is quite intriguing. Tell us more about it.</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf Nishat:</strong> Thank you, Devika! So, the story behind ‘Traveling Muser’ goes back to February 2007, when I first started journaling. That’s where ‘Muser’ comes in—I still journal to this day. And ‘Traveling’ reflects my passion for exploring new places. Whenever I travel, I find myself filled with thoughts and reflections that I love to pen down. It just felt natural to combine the two into a username that truly represents me. So, that’s how it all came together!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! When was the first time you realized that travel was your true calling?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> It actually happened during the second wave of COVID. I had lost my job and had been unemployed for almost five months. I was giving multiple interviews, feeling stressed and anxious, and desperately needed a change. Since I was staying in Delhi at the time, I decided to take a trip to Rajasthan.</p>
      <p>That journey was a turning point for me. It made me realize how small my problems really were in the grand scheme of things. Traveling gave me a profound sense of fulfillment. That was the moment I knew—no matter where I am or what I’m doing, travel needs to be an integral part of my life.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an inspiring realization. Travel not only helps you explore the world but also discover yourself. Now, as a traveler, do you plan your trips down to the last detail, or do you prefer to go with the flow? Are you a planner?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I’d say both—it totally depends on the situation. There have been trips I’ve planned for months in advance, organizing every detail from the stays to the itinerary. But then there are also trips that happen on a whim. Sometimes, my husband and I decide the night before—or even the same morning—that we’re going somewhere, and off we go! So, it’s really a mix of both.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds exciting! Which type of trip do you enjoy more?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Definitely the impromptu ones. There’s something so thrilling about an unexpected adventure, something you didn’t plan for but just happened. It makes the experience more enjoyable and adventurous.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! Spontaneous trips often lead to the best memories. So, tell me—where did you grow up, and how has your childhood shaped your love for travel?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I was born in Chennai, but because my dad had a transferable job, we were constantly moving to different cities. I spent the majority of my childhood in Bangalore, where I completed my schooling. My love for travel definitely comes from my father—he was passionate about exploring new places. Every year, especially on my parents’ anniversary, it was a given that we would take a trip. Whether it was Kashmir, Andaman, Shimla, or the Northeast, I’ve seen most of India with my dad.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a beautiful way to grow up! Do you have any fond childhood memories that stand out?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> It’s hard to pick just one, but as a family, we loved celebrating birthdays. We had this tradition of planning special activities, like treasure hunts, rapid-fire rounds, and quizzes, to make the birthday person feel extra special. Those moments, filled with fun and laughter, are something I miss the most now that I don’t live with my family.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! Birthdays always hold a special place in our hearts. Who has been the biggest influence in your life, and why?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Without a doubt, my father. Not just because of his love for travel, but because he never confined himself to just one thing. He taught us to explore, to be curious, and to never limit ourselves. That lesson has shaped me deeply.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an inspiring perspective—allowing yourself the freedom to explore and embrace multiple passions.</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! He always encouraged us to believe that we didn’t have to box ourselves into a single role. Just because you’re good at one thing doesn’t mean you can’t explore something else. That mindset has stayed with me throughout my journey.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly remarkable. Would you like to expand on that a bit more?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Absolutely! My father showed me the value of having multiple passions. Right now, I have a nine-to-five job, but I’m also a content creator, and I’m planning to start my own small business. This mindset comes from him—he was a government officer, but at a certain point, he resigned, studied law, and even wrote articles. Seeing him juggle different interests was eye-opening. It made me realize that you don’t have to confine yourself to just one thing.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so empowering. A lot of people think they can’t multitask, but in reality, we all have the ability—we just need to embrace it.</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! You don’t have to box yourself in. Just because you have a job doesn’t mean you can’t dream of becoming a travel influencer. And just because you’re an influencer doesn’t mean you can’t start your own business. There are no rules that say you must stick to just one path.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true! Life is meant to be explored fully—just like in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara! If you could talk to your younger self, what advice would you give about following your passion?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> This is actually something I tell my younger sisters as well: Always believe in yourself. No matter what happens, never lose faith in your abilities. People will have opinions, but at the end of the day, your belief in yourself is what matters the most.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Self-belief is the foundation of success. Now, tell us about your educational background. Where did you study? Was it related to travel in any way?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Not at all! My education had nothing to do with travel or influencing. I studied in multiple cities for my schooling, then pursued my BTEC in Kolkata, followed by an MBA in Bhubaneswar. After completing my studies, I secured a job through campus placement.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting! So how did you end up in travel influencing?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> It was never part of my plan. During the COVID pandemic, I lost my job as a fresher, which was a tough time for many. That's when I started traveling—not as an influencer, but just for the love of exploring new places. The idea of sharing my journeys online came much later. Initially, I would simply post travel edits for fun. You know, back when trending audios were a thing, and people would create quick transitions to match the beats. That’s how it started for me—just a hobby. But early last year, I realized that I genuinely enjoyed creating travel content, and maybe, just maybe, I could take it to the next level. And here I am!</p>
            
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So in a way, travel influencing was your plan B?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Absolutely! It wasn’t something I had envisioned for myself. I used to watch other travel influencers and think, "That looks amazing," but I never imagined myself in their shoes. Somehow, though, I think I subconsciously manifested it. Looking back, everything just fell into place naturally.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! Speaking of travel influencers, do you have a favorite?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes! Right now, I’m really inspired by Ankit Bhatia. His content is amazing.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had the chance to collaborate with an influencer, would it be Ankit Bhatia?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, for sure! I absolutely love his content. The way he tells stories, showcases places, and connects with his audience is incredible. I don’t think there’s anyone else doing it quite like him at the moment.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! Now, tell me about the quirkiest place you’ve stayed in during your travels.</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, that would be in Panchgani! We stayed at a hotel where every room had a different theme. There was a penguin-themed room where everything was decorated with penguins, a forest-themed room, and even a striking red room. It was definitely a unique experience!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds so interesting! Now, let’s talk about travel trends. What’s one trend you absolutely love and one that you find overrated?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I love slow traveling. Even when we’re on bike trips and crossing states, we like to take our time—stopping for a day or two to immerse ourselves in the local culture rather than just rushing to the final destination. I think that really enhances the experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> As for an overrated trend, I’d say Instagrammable spots. People hype up places like the Bali swing just because they look great in pictures, but when you visit in real life, the experience often doesn’t match the expectation. Everything is heavily edited, and when you actually get there, it’s crowded and not as magical as it seemed online.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great point! So, the key takeaway would be to research before visiting an “Insta-famous” spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! For instance, I was planning a trip to Turkey this year and came across Pamukkale. It looks absolutely surreal in pictures, but after watching reality videos, I realized it might not be as breathtaking in person. That kind of thing can be a real letdown!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a good insight. Doing thorough research can really help travelers make the most of their trips. Now, tell me—what’s something about your personality from childhood that you think still shines through today?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Hmm, I think that’s something my parents would be able to answer better! But from what people tell me, I’ve always been known as a sweet person. Even as a kid, I would hear that a lot, and I think that part of me has remained unchanged.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! I can tell you’re a genuinely kind person, even in just the short time we’ve spoken. For example, I was a very curious kid—I always had questions about everything, and that curiosity has stayed with me. Would you say there’s a childhood hobby or interest you’ve rediscovered through your travels?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Actually, I think I’ve lost a couple of hobbies over the years because life has been so demanding. I used to paint, do glass painting, and lots of crafts, but I haven’t been able to keep up with those. However, one thing that traveling has rekindled in me is journaling. I always carry my journal with me, and I love to write whenever I have time—especially at airports or during flights. It helps me reflect on my experiences and capture my thoughts.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really beautiful! Now, here’s a more philosophical question. If your younger self could see you now, what do you think they would say?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I think they would say, “You made it.” Not necessarily in terms of career success, but in life. I’ve always wanted a supportive environment where I could be myself and do what I love. Today, I have a wonderful, supportive partner and family, and that’s exactly what I always hoped for. So in that sense, I think I’ve truly made it.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, Sadaf, you've had quite an adventurous journey. Tell me, what’s the wildest story you’ve collected during your travels?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, wow! That’s a tough one, but something really wild happened just recently. We were exploring Maharashtra on our bikes, and somehow, we took a wrong turn. At first, we didn’t think much of it, but as we rode further, the red flags started popping up. Still, we thought, “Let’s see what’s ahead.”</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> We kept going, crossing mountains and streams. Everything seemed fine—until it wasn’t. The terrain became rough, dangerous even. At one point, we fell, and the bike’s alignment got completely messed up. We were exhausted, completely drained, and to top it all off, there was no clear way forward. That’s when reality hit us—we needed to figure out how to get back.</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Just when we thought we were stuck, we spotted a local woman, the only person in sight, washing her buffaloes. With no common language between us, we resorted to sign language, desperately asking for directions. Thankfully, she understood and pointed us toward the highway. It was a nerve-wracking yet incredible experience. I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, but it sure made for an unforgettable adventure!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! That could have turned into a real travel mishap, but instead, it became a thrilling story to tell. Speaking of which, have you ever had a travel mishap that, despite the challenges, turned into a cherished memory?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> This particular incident definitely qualifies! It could have been a complete disaster, but looking back, it was just another lesson in adventure and resilience. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve had any other major mishaps—at least not yet!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Now, shifting gears a bit—what’s been the most unexpected cultural experience that has really stayed with you?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, this one is recent too! We were in Georgia, a country rich in history and traditions. The Georgian language and culture are fascinating. We visited Kazbegi, a breathtaking region at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Where? Where exactly in Georgia?</p>
            <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Kazbegi.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay.</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yeah, it’s a mountainous region in Georgia. We went there, and suddenly, we experienced this huge cultural shift that we hadn’t anticipated. We were still using Google Translate to convert English to Georgian, but when we arrived, we realized that it was a predominantly Russian-speaking settlement. The people there spoke Russian, and they were incredibly warm and welcoming.</p>
      <p>The moment they met us, they were like, "Oh! Indians! Indians are so sweet and beautiful!" It completely caught us off guard. We hadn’t expected such a reaction, but then we realized we were right at the Russian border, so it made sense.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow, that sounds like an exciting and unexpected experience! How long did you stay there?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> We stayed in Kazbegi for about two to three days. Overall, our trip to Georgia lasted around ten days.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing! Was ten days enough to explore everything?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, though you could always stay longer and explore even more. Georgia has three major cities worth visiting: Tbilisi, Kazbegi, and Batumi. Each of them offers a completely different experience. Kazbegi is all about mountains and nature. Tbilisi has an old city charm, with cobblestone streets and historical architecture. And then there’s Batumi, which is more about beaches, casinos, and a lively party scene. It was the perfect blend of adventure, history, and relaxation.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, good. Excellent! Now, given that you've traveled to so many places, if you could live anywhere from your travels, which place would it be?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Honestly, wherever I go, I always feel like, "I wish I could live here!" But if I had to pick one place, it would be Goa. My husband and I have made it a tradition to visit Goa every year. We love it so much that we often talk about moving there someday.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> The Goa vibe, huh?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes! It’s just something about the Goa vibe—the relaxed atmosphere, the culture, the energy—it’s irresistible.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So is it mainly because of the beaches?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Surprisingly, no! I’m actually more of a mountain person. But like I said, it’s the vibe, the culture, and the lifestyle that really draw us in. It just feels like home.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Now, you've been traveling for a while. How do you think it has shaped your perspective on life and relationships?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Every travel adventure gives me a new perspective on life and relationships. In my case, my husband and I have grown so much together through our trips. Traveling has played a huge role in strengthening our bond.</p>
      <p>In fact, when we were dating, we took our first road trip just a month into our relationship. It was a small day trip to Yelagiri, but it set the foundation for our shared love of travel. Since then, every journey has brought us closer and taught us valuable lessons about each other. So yes, travel is an essential part of our relationship!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so cool! Travel truly has a way of shaping us in ways we never expect. Any other perspectives on life that you feel travel has added value to? Maybe something like patience, resilience, or a shift in mindset?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, absolutely! Traveling has filled me with a deep sense of gratitude. Every time I return from a trip, I find myself appreciating life so much more. When you’re caught up in the hustle of city life—juggling work, responsibilities, and daily stress—you rarely take a moment to reflect on the good things. Travel gives me that space. Being in a beautiful, unfamiliar place, away from daily distractions, fills me with positive energy and appreciation.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! Gratitude is such a powerful shift in perspective.</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, and it stays with me even after I return. Travel makes you realize how vast and beautiful the world is, and it helps you stay present and thankful for each experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Now, what’s one thing people assume about travel influencers that you think is completely untrue?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, this one’s easy! People often think that we have the perfect life. They assume that being a travel influencer means we’re constantly having fun, enjoying every moment without a care in the world. But the reality is very different!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sadaf, there’s a common perception that travel influencers are always living their best life. But you and I both know that’s only part of the story. What’s your take on this?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, absolutely! If someone really needs to bust this myth, it’s now. Being a travel content creator is tough—it’s definitely not as perfect as it appears on Instagram. What you see online is just about 10% of the good parts. A lot happens behind the scenes that people don’t see.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Can you share an experience where the reality was very different from what you posted?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Of course! I was traveling to Ollie, and we took a train. During that trip, I caught some sort of infection—probably from using a public toilet. It lingered throughout my entire journey. Honestly, I spent most of the trip in bed, feeling awful. But, when I felt a little better for a couple of days, I stepped out and captured some content. That’s what I posted on Instagram. So, my audience saw me exploring, but they had no idea about the struggle behind the scenes.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That really puts things into perspective. It’s such a clear example of ‘reel vs. real.’</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! The ‘real’ in reality is always different from what we choose to showcase.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s switch things up with a quick rapid-fire round! Mountains or beaches?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Mountains, for sure!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Solo travel or group trips?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Group trips.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting! Have you ever traveled solo?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Not really. I mean, I have traveled with groups of strangers, but I wouldn’t call that a true solo trip.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Would you ever consider doing a completely solo trip?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> It’s absolutely fine not to travel solo. I still feel that if I traveled alone, I might feel lonely, and that holds me back. So, yeah, let’s see. Maybe in the future, if I want to, I will for sure.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Good. Sunrise hikes or sunset dinners?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Sunset! I am not a morning person. I hate waking up early.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A must-pack travel item you never leave home without?</p>
      <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Sanitizer.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very good choice! What’s one destination still on your bucket list?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, there are so many! But one that stands out is…</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How do you plan to take ‘Traveling Musa’ to the next level?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I want to evolve Traveling Musa into a business. Of course, I love creating content and want to continue doing so, but in the long run, it’s not sustainable to be a content creator forever. My ultimate goal is to turn it into a business, develop my own products, and use Traveling Musa as a distribution channel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nice! Now, if you could have your own travel show, what would it look like?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I think it would focus on real stories that happen during travel—things you don’t see on Instagram or YouTube. That’s a space that can definitely be explored.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How has your upbringing influenced your view on life today?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> My upbringing wasn’t particularly humble, but my parents always taught me the value of money and not to take it for granted. Even now, whenever I plan a trip or make any financial decision, I think twice about spending. For example, I wouldn’t pay $10 for something that’s worth $2. That lesson has stayed with me, and I value money a lot.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an important mindset! Anything else that has shaped your perspective?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, my parents also taught me to never take anything for granted. As a child, if something went wrong, they always encouraged me to look at the brighter side. That’s something that still helps me today. If my flight gets canceled or unexpected challenges arise, I instinctively start thinking about the positives—maybe it happened for a reason, maybe something better is ahead. Staying positive has played a major role in keeping me calm in difficult situations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s very true. I believe that, too—sometimes things don’t happen because they weren’t meant to, and it’s always for the best.</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! Constantly reminding yourself that everything happens for a reason really helps.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What values instilled in you as a child have helped you the most in your journey?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Honesty. It’s priceless to me. I prefer honesty over anything else, and I try to reflect that in my content. I don’t like showcasing something that isn’t true or exaggerated. Being genuine is important.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! Authenticity always shines through. People might be drawn to fake images initially, but in the long run, real connections are built on honesty and vulnerability.</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Absolutely!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, if you could take your younger self somewhere, where would that be and why?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Absolutely! I always wanted to go on treks or hikes, but whenever I suggested it to my parents, I was met with a firm "no." Now that I'm older, I plan to take my youngest sibling up to the mountains for a small trek or hike—something I missed out on as a child.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a beautiful way to relive those missed experiences! So, have you been on any treks or hikes so far?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes, I have! But I definitely want to do more in the coming semester.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! Now, let’s talk about your favorite childhood memory. What’s the one that stands out the most?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> My favorite childhood memory is celebrating birthdays. Those two to three hours of pure family time, where everyone comes together to make one person feel special, were truly magical.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a sweet memory! Everyone deserves that kind of love and attention. Now, tell me about your first travel adventure as a kid.</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Well, it’s not my very first trip, but it’s the one I remember vividly. We were traveling from Shimla to Manali when I was about five or six years old. I was on a bus, and as we navigated through the mountains, I noticed that half of the bus tire was on the road while the other half seemed to be dangling off the edge! Looking out of the window, all I could see was the deep valley below. It was terrifying yet incredibly adventurous. Back then, traveling wasn’t as convenient as it is today, which made every trip feel like a real adventure.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been quite an experience! Now, let’s talk about childhood dreams. What was your dream job when you were a kid?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, definitely an astronaut!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an amazing dream! It’s always fascinating to see how childhood aspirations shape who we become. Now, when you're traveling, what’s the one thing you miss about home?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Honestly, I don’t really miss home when I’m traveling. I just want to keep exploring! But if there’s one thing I do miss, it’s having a long, relaxing bath. That two- to three-hour shower at home with all my products—that’s something I sometimes long for.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an honest answer! Most people get emotional and talk about missing home or family, but I love how straightforward you are. Now, what’s the craziest thing you’ve ever eaten on a trip?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> I once ate rabbit! That was the craziest thing for me. When I was in Thailand, I saw crocodile and cockroach dishes too, but I just couldn’t bring myself to try them.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You didn’t want to be that adventurous, huh?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yeah, no! That was my limit.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one travel mistake you never want to repeat?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Riding without a good helmet. Safety first!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could travel to one place every year, what would it be? I think I already know the answer!</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Of course, Goa! And also Kashmir. I’ve been there twice, but I still want to go again.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense! Now, what’s the most overrated tourist spot you’ve been to?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> For me, it was Varkala. I know a lot of people love it, but my experience wasn’t great. It was super crowded, overly expensive, and the atmosphere wasn’t what I expected. So yeah, Varkala didn’t work for me.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fair! Now, tell me your favorite movie of all time.</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara—hands down!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A classic choice! Now, has there been an embarrassing travel moment?</p>
        <p><strong>Sadaf:</strong> Hmm… nothing I can recall right now.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you made any lifelong friends while traveling?</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Oh, absolutely! So many. The most recent was in Georgia, where I met some wonderful people from Maharashtra. We connected instantly, spoke throughout the journey, and have kept in touch ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Now, coffee or chai?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Both!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> A song that’s always on your travel playlist?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> In the End by Linkin Park.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great one! Do you want to sing a line for us?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> No way! I’m not much of a singer!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Fair enough! What’s a bucket list experience you’re dying to tick off?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Iceland.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And if you could live in one country for a year?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> I haven’t been to Bali yet, but I’d love to stay there for a long duration—maybe six months to a year. It’s one place I truly want to explore in depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Your dream travel partner, dead or alive?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Ankit Bhartia—he would take care of all the content creation!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the best compliment you’ve received from a fan?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> When people tell me I’m an inspiration, it feels surreal. I sometimes wonder if I even deserve that, but it’s incredibly humbling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Do you interact with your followers offline?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Yes! I keep my DMs open and try to respond to everyone. It’s important to stay connected with the community you’ve built.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> One piece of advice for aspiring travel influencers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Don’t wait for the perfect time—just start! Many aspiring influencers hesitate due to self-doubt, worrying about what others will say or not having the right gear. But if you want to make it, you just have to begin. There’s no “right time.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> One word to describe your journey so far?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Transformative.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> If a movie were made about your life, what would it be called?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> I’d have to think about that—it needs to truly resonate with me and my audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> A hashtag that represents you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> #Muser and #Believe—these words define my journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Any final thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Be yourself. Don’t just follow trends—create content that truly resonates with you. Everyone is trying to be someone else, but the real magic happens when you stay authentic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful advice—leave your mark!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Exactly! Behind the numbers, just be yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> It was a pleasure speaking with you, Sadaf!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sadaf:</strong> Likewise! Thank you so much!
