          </p>
       
          <p>
            <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Gunjan, to the Global Influencers Hub! This is where we delve into the inspiring journeys of social media influencers from around the world. This is a space where stories come alive—raw, real, and rooted in passion. We are thrilled to have you with us today, and we can’t wait to dive deep into your story. When I say “deep dive,” I mean we’re going to really explore your journey from the very beginning—your childhood, the challenges, and everything you’ve been through. We’re excited to hear your story, so feel free to take the stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan Dewan:</strong> Thank you for having me, Devika! I’m excited to share my journey with you all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s start from the beginning. How was Gunjan as a child? Can you tell us a bit about your early years?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Well, I’m the elder one in my house—the elder daughter, actually. I have a younger sister who’s about seven years younger than me. So, for her, I’ve always been like this "mom" figure in her life. I was also always the responsible child. Growing up in a joint family, I had the best of both worlds. On one hand, I had the responsibility of being the elder one, and on the other hand, I was pampered because I was the first child of my generation. We were three generations living together, so I had a lot of attention, which was pretty cool. Everyone used to listen to whatever I wanted, and it was great!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a fun combination of responsibility and pampering! I can relate in some way—I’m also the eldest child, though not the first in the entire generation. My dad’s the eldest in his family, so the dynamic was a bit different. But I get it now. You were definitely in the role of the responsible one growing up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Exactly! But when I was growing up, I was the pampered one, especially before I became that responsible elder child. I think being the first born in the generation does shape you. You end up being the one people rely on and the one expected to set examples. But when I reached college, I did have a little rebellious phase. That was a bit of a flip, haha!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense! So, tell us about your educational background. What path did you take academically?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> I have a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics (Honors), and then I went on to pursue a master’s in Data Science. Before I ventured into the world of food and parenting, I worked for about seven or eight years in the corporate sector as a data scientist. I had a taste of that world, but once I had Kian, my son, things shifted. After giving birth, I decided to take a break from my career in data science because managing both work and a newborn just didn’t seem possible. Around that time, my social media page started picking up traction, especially among parents and moms. It was in its early stages, but it was gaining momentum, and I decided to focus on that.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! That's an interesting shift. It seems like it all just evolved naturally for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Yes, it was completely organic. When I started, I was focusing a lot on baby-led weaning and introducing solids to children. Over time, my content expanded, and now it covers parenting, recipes, and sometimes a little bit of baby-led weaning because Kian is now two, and we’ve passed that stage. But yeah, it’s all evolved with time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so wonderful! So, Gunjan, were you a picky eater or more of a foodie as a child?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> I think I was a bit of both. I was picky when it came to the regular food like dal, roti, sabzi—up until I got married. You know how it is when you live with your parents—you can throw tantrums and get your way with food! But I also loved trying new foods. Whenever we traveled as a family, I loved exploring the local food, the regional dishes of the places we visited. So, while I could be a bit of a picky eater at home, I’ve always had a love for trying new cuisines and flavors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s awesome! I love the idea of exploring new food when you travel. It adds so much to the experience. If we were to ask your parents about a fun, food-related memory from your childhood, what do you think they would share with us?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Haha, a fun food memory... Well, I’ve been told repeatedly that I was obsessed with mangoes as a kid. Even now, I still can’t get enough of them! But when I was little, every summer when mangoes were in season, I’d always be found near someone who was eating mangoes. I would beg for their plate, and then by the end of it, I would be completely covered in mango juice, sitting in my clothes, just relishing every bite. They’d have to take my clothes off afterward because I was so messy. Mangoes were my thing!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Haha, that’s adorable! So, even now, you’re still totally into mangoes?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Definitely! If you give me a plate of mangoes now, it’s all mine. If I’m sharing with someone, that person isn’t getting any of it! Mangoes are still my weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> I can totally understand that. Now, let’s shift a bit. What’s your earliest memory of food or cooking?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> My dad has always been very into cooking and exploring food. He’s the one who got me interested in food. I grew up watching those Kana Khazana shows and TLC’s travel and food segments. Those were always on in our house, especially because my dad was the one who loved watching them. I think that’s what sparked my own interest in food. Also, on weekends, our family would cook meals together. My mom, dad, me, and my sister—one person would be doing something, and another would be doing something else. It was a really special experience. That’s what stands out to me when I think of food or cooking from my childhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a beautiful family tradition. Such a great way to bond! I can see why that experience has stuck with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> Absolutely. Cooking together as a family was something I really cherish. It definitely left a lasting impression on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s talk about your journey as a certified positive parenting coach. What inspired you to take that certification, and what does positive parenting mean in today’s world with so many different styles of parenting being discussed?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> I got certified as a positive parenting coach after Kian turned one. Before that, life was pretty smooth—everything was going well, and Kian was growing up. But once he hit the age of one and a half, the tantrums kicked in, and I started to feel lost. I knew I didn’t want to be the parent who screamed or shouted all the time, and I certainly didn’t want to hit him. But when faced with tantrums, I didn’t know what to do. That’s when I sought out a course and decided to learn about positive parenting. It really changed the way I looked at parenting—how I dealt with my child’s behavior and my own emotions in those moments. I did a few personal sessions with parents through my page, but eventually, time became a constraint, so I paused that for now.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a transformative journey! And with so many parenting styles out there, what do you think positive parenting brings to the table?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Gunjan:</strong> For me, positive parenting is all about validation and calmness. It just makes logical sense. For instance, if your child is crying, instead of dismissing their feelings or getting irritated, you acknowledge their emotions and let them know you understand. Crying is just their way of expressing themselves, and it’s important to remain calm. When you stay composed, it helps your child calm down too. It’s not just about handling tantrums but also about supporting their emotional development and brain development. It makes parenting feel more balanced and, frankly, more logical than shouting or reacting negatively.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful way of looking at it, and I completely agree. It’s just something that makes so much logical sense to me, you know? I feel like I should share a little bit from my end too. I was always very strict, especially when I was growing up. My mom was super stern with me, and, as you know, the whole Indian style of parenting can be a bit intense. I used to tell her, “I don’t want to be like you. I don’t want to become like that with my own child.” My mom was pretty strict, and growing up, I often thought, “I’m not going to do this with my child.” And then, as luck would have it, my son was born in the U.S. And, oh, let me tell you, that’s a whole different setup altogether. In the U.S., you can’t scream at your child or do anything out of line because, you know, there are laws and guidelines. I had to shift my approach. We used to do time-outs with him, and that was the solution we found—just let him sit quietly. But the funniest thing happened when we visited India. My dad saw me giving my son a time-out, and he was like, “What is he doing? Why are you making him sit there? What’s going on?”</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Oh my god, I can already imagine the look on your dad’s face! What did you do?</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I was like, “Let me discipline him.” But my dad didn’t buy it. He went right over, grabbed my son’s hand, and said, “No, he’s not just going to sit there like that!” I was like, “Okay, fine, I’ll let you take over!” It's funny how everything changes when it comes to their grandkids.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Haha, it’s so true! My parents are exactly the same! Whenever we visit, I have such a tough time disciplining Kian. My parents and in-laws just can’t say no to him. They spoil him so much! He gets away with everything.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! And then my son started figuring it out. During our India visit, he realized, “Oh, I can do whatever I want because they won’t stop me.” My cousins would be like, “What if we make you sit in a corner?” and I’m just like, “No, don’t do that!” It’s crazy! But that’s the reality of parenting, isn’t it?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Haha, yes, that’s the thing with grandparents! They’re just so soft on their grandkids, it becomes impossible to maintain discipline!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. But, Gunjan, speaking of challenges, one thing I hear a lot from parents is how hard it is to stay calm. It’s so difficult when your child is having a tantrum or is just being really difficult. How do you manage to stay calm when that happens?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Ah, that’s the big question! And it’s something that a lot of parents come to me with as well. The biggest principle in positive parenting is staying calm, especially when your child is throwing a tantrum. But I know how tough it can be. I used to really struggle with it, too. Crying or screaming from your child can be incredibly triggering, especially when it goes on for so long. It can make you anxious and uncomfortable. I used to feel that way too, and it was so hard to not just lose it.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, it’s so uncomfortable, and you just don’t know how to handle it. How did you learn to deal with it?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Honestly, the key is just breathing through it. When Kian throws a tantrum, I’ve learned that the first thing I need to do is take a deep breath. It's so important to work on yourself outside the situation, but in the moment, just focus on your breathing and remind yourself that it’s just a phase—it will pass. It’s okay for them to cry it out because that’s how they express their emotions. I know that crying isn’t a bad thing, and it’s actually one of the least harmful ways they can express themselves.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I completely agree! Sometimes, we forget that crying is just a natural way for kids to express themselves. But it's so challenging when you’re in the moment.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Exactly! And reminding myself that it’s just a phase really helps. I’ve learned that if I stay calm and don’t react negatively, Kian can actually pick up on that energy. He knows that it’s okay to express himself, but he also learns from my calmness.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a great perspective! I’ve learned the same thing. I used to get frustrated when my son would scream, but now I’ve realized that staying calm not only helps me, but it also helps him.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Right? And another thing that really helps is knowing that tantrums are temporary. Eventually, they’ll stop crying, and they’ll move on to the next phase. So, just breathing through it really helps me manage those moments without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really great advice, Gunjan. It’s all about being patient and knowing that this phase will pass. Now, Kian is two years old, right? That’s such a fun age, but I can imagine it also comes with its own set of challenges.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Yes, exactly! Two-year-olds are tricky. They’re learning so much about their own independence, and that can lead to a lot of tantrums and testing boundaries. But it’s also such a beautiful phase because they start expressing themselves in new ways.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I completely agree. It’s definitely the beginning of the journey, and I’m sure it gets easier with time, as you both learn and grow together. So, what’s one parenting myth you wish people would stop believing?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> There are so many! But if I had to pick just one, it would be the idea that children will "just grow up on their own." Before becoming a parent, we’re often told that it’s no big deal—kids will just grow up, like we did. But it doesn’t happen that way. Children need constant attention. They need their primary caregiver, someone there for them, guiding them through their growth. It’s not something that just magically happens on its own.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a really important message. I think many people don’t fully grasp how crucial that constant presence is.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Exactly! It's something both parents and society need to understand—that parenting requires active participation. It's not a passive process.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. You also mentioned another parenting myth earlier. Could you share that one too?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Sure. It’s not exactly a myth, but it's closely related to what we were talking about: the idea that anger or physical punishment is the only way to discipline a child. Especially in India, this is still very common. Many believe that shouting or even hitting a child is the only way they’ll learn. But that’s a huge misconception.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I agree with you. I think it’s something that leaves lasting emotional scars.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Yes. When we think back to our childhood, what do we remember about being shouted at or hit? It’s usually feelings of embarrassment or resentment, not understanding why we were being punished. The message behind the punishment gets lost, and all we remember is the physical or emotional pain.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s true. And you’re right—when a child is punished, the behavior they're learning is not about the mistake they made, but rather how to react to it with anger or aggression.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Exactly. If a child lies, for instance, and the response is anger or physical punishment, they’re not learning about honesty. They're learning that anger or violence is an appropriate reaction to mistakes. But children are just exploring, experimenting with the world. Lying is a natural part of that development. Instead of responding with anger, it’s more effective to have a conversation about why lying is wrong. Shouting or hitting only causes harm, not learning.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That was such a powerful point. I’m really glad you shared that.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Thank you. I feel strongly about it, and I've always made it a point never to raise my hand to my child. We’ve also made sure in our family that nobody raises their voice above a certain level in front of him. We want him to learn that if he wants people to listen to him, he doesn’t need to scream.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that approach. Now, let’s talk about boundaries. What does the word ‘boundary’ mean to you?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> To me, boundaries are like rules—things that are non-negotiable. For example, limiting screen time to 30 minutes a day, or saying only one chocolate per week. These are boundaries that you set for your child, things that they need to understand are firm and non-negotiable.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great way to look at it. Boundaries help children understand limits, and it's important to set them early on.</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Absolutely. Boundaries help create structure and clarity for children, which they need to feel safe and secure.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could go back in time and give yourself one piece of advice before becoming a mom, what would it be?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> I’d tell myself that sometimes things won’t go as planned, and that’s okay. Especially during those first few months, when everything feels like chaos. You’re sleep-deprived, your body’s going through hormonal changes, and you’re trying to adjust to this new role. A lot of the plans you have before becoming a mom won’t always work out, and that’s perfectly fine. It’s all part of the journey.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Such great advice. Now, how do you handle those challenging moments?</p>

          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> The same advice I give others—just breathe through it. Breathe deeply, stay calm, and try not to get overwhelmed. It’s easy to lose it in the moment, but focusing on your breath can help you regain control.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you meditate?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> I don’t actively meditate right now. I did try it for a while, but it’s not something I’ve been able to keep up with in my routine. However, breathing exercises definitely help me stay grounded in tough situations.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. It’s tough to keep up with everything, especially when you’re juggling so much. Now, what inspired you to start sharing baby-friendly recipes?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> The idea for baby-friendly recipes came from my own experience. When I was starting solids with Kian, I couldn’t find any Indian pages or resources focused on baby-led weaning. People were sharing recipes, but no one was really covering how to offer traditional Indian foods, like dal chawal or roti, in a baby-led weaning format. I was doing it with Kian anyway, so I thought, why not share it? Thankfully, the response was amazing from the start.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic! It must have been so rewarding to see the positive response from your audience.</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> It was! Once Kian started eating a wider variety of foods, my followers began asking for recipes. Initially, I wasn’t keen on sharing recipes because it’s a lot of work, but I eventually started doing it. To my surprise, the recipes got even better engagement than my other content. So, I thought, why not? Let’s go with it!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! How was your experience of introducing solids to Kian?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Honestly, it was nerve-wracking at first. I was going against everyone’s advice—family, friends, everyone thought I was crazy. But once I stuck with it, it became such a magical experience. Every day brought something new, and Kian got better at eating and chewing. Even my husband got really involved, and it became a beautiful family experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! Any funny or messy moments from that time?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Oh yes, one of the messiest moments involved dragon fruit. Kian loved red dragon fruit, but it made such a mess! His face, his hands, the highchair—all covered in red and purple. But he loved it so much that I’d always give it to him, even though it was so messy!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a typical baby experience—so messy, but so adorable!</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Definitely! And I’ve got lots of pictures to remember those moments.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It's so important to talk about safety, especially when it comes to introducing food to babies. Many parents worry about the choking hazard. What's your take on that, Gunjan?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Absolutely, parents do have concerns about that, and rightly so. My best safety tip would be to first educate yourself. Before introducing any solids, it's crucial to know the choking hazards and how to offer food safely. The size, consistency, and texture of food matter a lot. And, of course, learn basic first aid so you’re prepared if anything goes wrong. The good news is that whether you’re doing baby-led weaning or traditional weaning, both methods carry the same risk when it comes to choking. It's not that baby-led weaning increases the chances. Whether you’re spoon-feeding or letting your baby feed themselves, being mindful of food safety is key for both.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s reassuring. So, what's your all-time favorite baby-friendly recipe that even adults can enjoy?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Oh, pasta! There's a pumpkin pasta recipe on my page that I absolutely love. It was my dad’s birthday last week, and I made it. The plates were wiped clean, even by adults! Every time I make it, I feel like it tastes better than the last time. It’s not a typical pink pasta, but it's been a huge hit among both parents and kids.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds delicious! I’ll definitely check it out. Now, how do you make kids love healthy food?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> There are two things that really work. First, introduce a variety of foods early. As soon as they start solids, offer different textures, flavors, and food combinations. The more they experience early on, the more likely they are to accept it later. For example, my son loves broccoli because I introduced it to him right from the beginning.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great tip! And what if your child is a little older and is refusing healthy food?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> If that happens, make sure you're not stressing over it. Don't make a big deal about food rejection. Kids pick up on that, and it can turn into a bigger issue. Figure out why they’re rejecting food—maybe they’re teething, going through a growth spurt, or just not feeling well. It’s totally normal for them to reject food now and then. And remember, the more you worry, the more pressure you put on them. If you remain calm and unbothered, they’ll likely come around when they’re ready.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really comforting to hear. And what’s your stance on sugar intake for kids?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Sugar intake should definitely be as limited as possible. There are guidelines available for how much sugar is okay for different age groups. For my son, I’ve avoided refined sugar as much as I can, especially before two years old. Instead, I try to use natural sweeteners like dates, honey, or maple syrup, but only in limited quantities. Even if it's something like a date-based cookie, I make sure it’s not a daily thing. Sweet foods can be addictive, and if you give them too much, they may start refusing savory foods.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That's such a balanced approach. If babies could talk, what do you think they'd say about your recipes?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Well, my son always says, “Acha laga!” which means "It was good." But it’s funny how he keeps saying that—sometimes I think he's just trying to make me feel good!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s adorable! Now, could you share your top three upgraded superfoods for kids?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Sure! First, sweet potatoes. Not many people realize how great they are for toddlers. They're packed with nutrients and are calorie-dense, so they're perfect for growing kids. Second, eggs—such a great source of protein. If eggs aren’t an option, then cheese or paneer can work as a substitute. And third, nuts and seeds. I add these to almost everything—pancakes, chilas, even rice. It’s an easy way to boost nutrition.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Those are fantastic options! I wish I had your recipes when my kids were younger. Now, how should parents handle meal rejections?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> It’s really similar to what I said about making them enjoy healthy food. Don’t make a big deal out of it. If your child rejects food and you keep stressing over it, they’ll continue rejecting food just to get your attention. Instead, try to understand the cause. Maybe they’re teething, not feeling well, or going through a developmental leap. And remember, they’ll eat when they’re ready. If you stay calm, it will pass.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Such a calm, rational approach! What’s next for your channel?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Right now, my Instagram is all about recipes. But I also have a YouTube channel that I want to revive. On Instagram, I focus on food, but on YouTube, I plan to dive deeper into parenting—sharing my experiences and learnings through each phase. I recently potty-trained my son, and I’m planning to share that entire journey on YouTube because long-form content gives me the space to really elaborate and make it relatable. I also shared my weaning-off breastfeeding experience, and the response was fantastic. People appreciated the detailed approach, so I definitely want to continue that.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a great plan! How do you engage with your followers now that your page has grown?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> As my page grows, I do find it harder to interact with every follower, but I still try to respond to DMs daily. Initially, I could respond to all of them, but now I focus on the recurring themes in DMs. If a lot of people ask similar questions, I create content around that. It’s a great way to keep engaging and still offer valuable information to my followers.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a smart way to stay connected! So, who’s been your biggest role model or inspiration?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Without a doubt, my mom. She’s such a strong, inspiring woman. She was a homemaker for most of her life, but always had this desire to do something more. Recently, she completed a diploma in nutrition and is now building her brand as a nutritionist and dietitian, especially focusing on female and postpartum health. She’s 55 and starting a whole new chapter in her career. Whenever I feel demotivated, I think about her, and I’m like, “What’s my excuse?”</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. Say hello to her from me!</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> I will, for sure!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, let's wrap this up with some rapid-fire questions!</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Sure! Let's do it!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Messy mealtime or picture-perfect meals?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Messy meals. Always. Of course.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One food trend that needs to go?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> That milk and wheat are bad. It's not. I don't know why people think that dairy or gluten is bad. It just doesn’t suit some people, but that doesn’t make it bad for everyone.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could have dinner with any parenting expert, who would that be?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> My mentor, Dr. Ishina. She’s the one I did the positive parenting coaching program with. I’ve never actually met her in person—only online. I’d love to meet her someday.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you always carry in your mom bag?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Wet wipes.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had to rename Baby Led Weaning, what would you call it?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Raising adventurous eaters.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s nice! One positive parenting tip that works magic every time?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Let your child have what they want once in a while. Don’t always say no. Be their friend too. It’s about letting them experience things that don’t harm them. For example, if they want to play with water, just let them. Hearing “yes” is really important.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Funniest thing your child has ever said about your food?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> So, one time, he tasted something that was really delicious. But for some reason, he doesn’t like dal makhani or shahi paneer. So whenever I make it, he makes faces and says, “Why did you make this today?” It’s hilarious because he doesn’t even call it by the right name—he just makes faces.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your number one "me-time" activity?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Just watching TV. I used to be a big couch potato before Kian, but now I try to catch up on OTT shows and movies whenever I get the chance.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you weren’t doing what you do now, what would your alternate career be?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Honestly, I don’t think I have one. Before this, I worked as a data scientist for seven years, and at the time, I thought that was my dream job. But when I shifted to what I’m doing now, I realized that I didn’t know this level of satisfaction was even possible. So, right now, I’m so content with what I’m doing. No alternate career for me!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You seem so satisfied with your work!</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Yeah, when I see messages from moms saying their child finally ate something after days of rejection, it fills me with so much happiness. That’s the most satisfying part of it all.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If your life had a book title, what would it be?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> I have no idea! But my life has been about hard work and taking chances. I’m always the person who says “yes” to things that others might not. Maybe something around that—like Chances Taken.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Chances Taken—I like it!</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Yeah, it’s cool, right?</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, wonderful talking to you, Gunjan. I think we’ve covered most of it. If we have any more questions or need pictures, my team will reach out to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Sure! It’s been a great experience, and I’m happy to help whenever needed.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One last question: Do you have any feedback for us at Global Influencers Hub?</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> It’s been great talking to you and your team. I’m excited to know more about the next steps. Maybe someone from your team can get in touch.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, they’ll definitely get back to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Gunjan:</strong> Awesome! Thanks so much, Devika. It was lovely talking to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lovely talking to you too. Lots of love, Gunjan. Bye!</p>
