              <p>
              Neole Anna Corneliois a rising star in athletics, known for her dedication, resilience, and passion for the sport. Beyond her achievements on the track, she is also a creative entrepreneur with a keen interest in fashion and crochet. In this exclusive interview, Devika Majumder, co-founder of the Global Influencers Hub, explores Neole’s journey—from her early love for running to her highly anticipated debut as a senior athlete. She shares insights into her training, mindset, and the philosophy that drives her forward, offering an inspiring glimpse into the life of a multifaceted and determined young athlete.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Neole! Welcome to Global Influencers Hub. Here, we talk about the life journeys of influencers, and today, we’re eager to explore yours. Let’s dive right in! We’d love to hear about your journey—your stories, experiences, and everything in between. Let’s start from the very beginning. Tell us about your early childhood and how your love for sports began.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Neole Cornelio:</strong> Hi, Devika! Thank you for having me. My journey with sports started in quite an unexpected way. As a child, I was a little plump, slightly overweight. Wanting me to be more active, my mom randomly signed me up for a school relay race, not knowing what would come of it—she just wanted me to move more.
I had a pre-nursery teacher named Miss Anna, and I think she saw some potential in me. She used to bribe me, saying, “Come for the relay, and I’ll treat you to grilled chicken.” And, well, the thought of chicken was enough to get me running! So, in LKG, I started participating in school-level races—not out of deep interest, but because my mom encouraged me to.
Over time, running became part of my routine. Initially, I didn’t think of it as something I could quit. Training was in the morning, and it just became second nature to me. Slowly, I began enjoying it more and more. Then, in third grade, I got a new coach, Malisa, who joined our school. He played a significant role in shaping me as an athlete, training me meticulously and ensuring my performance remained consistent through my senior category. Under his guidance, I competed in several national tournaments and won numerous medals.
Of course, as you progress in the sport, it becomes essential to have a team, a dedicated training group, and a proper club. That’s when I decided to pursue athletics professionally. In 2021, I turned pro and joined a different club to take my training to the next level. But looking back, it’s funny to think that my entire journey started simply because of my love for grilled chicken!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, who was your biggest influence at that time? Your mom?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> I wouldn’t say my mom was my biggest influence, but she has always been my greatest motivator. When it comes to sports, there was no one in my family involved in athletics—I was the first to reach this level.
I do have cousins who are into comedy and cricket, but no one ever thought that an athlete could emerge from my family. My journey was entirely self-motivated.

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! And who is your biggest support now?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Definitely my family—my mom, dad, and brother. They never pressure me to do anything other than running. For them, athletics comes first, and education is secondary. The first question in our house is always about my training, and everything else comes later. Their unwavering support and motivation keep me going.
              </p>

        
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Having a strong support system is so important. So, what has been the biggest turning point in your life?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : I would say COVID was a major turning point for me. I have a genetic predisposition to gain weight easily and a naturally low metabolism. In Indian athletics, most female athletes are lean, tall, and have a straight structural build. In contrast, I have a broader frame with bigger thighs, glutes, and arms, making me a heavy-built athlete.
During COVID, I gained a significant amount of weight and struggled to run. Even completing a small repetition felt like a challenge. That period made me question whether athletics was really working out for me. It was a tough realization, but it pushed me to make a crucial decision—I left my old coach and joined a new pro team. I knew my body type was uncommon, so I needed a more scientific and active approach to training.
Switching to my current coach, Binder Rani, reignited my passion for athletics. That’s when I truly started craving training and chasing performance. COVID was a turning point not just for me, but for many athletes. Those two years tested our patience, with no events and constant uncertainty. Many of us struggled with weight gain and stagnation.
However, I eventually saw it as an opportunity. I realized I needed more—more training, more effort, and a fresh approach. That shift in mindset made all the difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. So, what is one life lesson that sports has taught you—something you’ll carry with you forever?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Trust. Trust the person you’ve put your faith in. If you’re training under a coach, you need to believe in their methods and guidance. I’ve seen many athletes train for four or five months and then leave because they don’t see immediate improvement. But what I’ve learned is that real progress takes time.
I had to put my complete trust in my coach. I was essentially placing my entire body in her hands and trusting that she would show me the right way. This lesson applies beyond sports too—whether it’s a teacher, mentor, or guide, you have to trust in the process and the person leading you. Success doesn’t happen overnight. It requires patience, effort, and unwavering dedication. That belief has stayed with me.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! Now, tell us—what does a typical day in the life of Neole Carnelio look like?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> I start my day at 5:40 in the morning. After waking up, I go through my pre-workout rituals, eat a light snack, and head to the track. By 7:00 AM, I begin training, which lasts until anywhere between 9:30 and 10:30 AM, depending on the day.
The track is about a 45-minute journey from home, so by the time I return, it’s almost 11:00 or 12:00 noon. I eat breakfast, take a short nap, and then have lunch. By 3:30 PM, I’m back at training, and I usually get home around 7:00 PM.
As soon as I reach home, I take a shower, spend a little time on my phone, and then head to bed. My entire day revolves around training and eating—half the time, I’m just refueling my body! Studying is minimal, but if exams are approaching and I start feeling the pressure, that’s when I squeeze in some study time.

              </p>



              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s quite a packed schedule! Now, tell us about the biggest challenge you’ve faced so far and how you overcame it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : One of the toughest challenges I’ve faced was dealing with a serious injury. I had a grade-three hamstring tear, which took about six to eight months to heal. During that time, I was stuck at home, unable to train or do much of anything. I still had to attend college every day, but it was a really difficult period for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredibly tough, both physically and mentally. How did you cope with being sidelined for so long?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Honestly, it was a real test for me. I was in a phase where I didn’t know what to do—whether I should continue or just stop altogether. Missing out on important events was heartbreaking. I even had to sit out two international selection trials because of the injury. But slowly, I started recovering and getting back into training.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been a challenging journey back to form. Was there a turning point in your recovery?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Yes! Right after my injury, my first major event was Khelo India, and I managed to win a bronze medal. That was my first national medal post-injury, and it was an incredibly emotional moment. I remember my coach and me crying in a corner. I had never seen her cry before, and that moment meant everything to us.

              </p>





              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : That’s such a powerful story. Aside from injuries, have you faced other challenges in your career, especially in terms of perception and body image in athletics?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Definitely. In Indian athletics, there’s a certain physique that coaches and people expect from athletes. Since I don’t fit that traditional mold, I’ve faced a lot of criticism. People have bullied me, both online and offline, for my body type. I used to get called “fat” and “overweight.” Some even referred to me as “Jamaican” because of my muscular build, which at first felt like mockery.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That kind of negativity must have been tough to deal with. How did you handle it?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> When I was younger, it really hurt me. Seeing negative comments on YouTube and social media was painful. But over time, I’ve learned to embrace my body. Now, I take those comments as a compliment. If people say I look like a Jamaican athlete, I take pride in that! I’ve grown to love and appreciate my body for what it is, and I no longer care about what others think.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. It’s excellent that you’re speaking out about this because bullying in athletics is real.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Yeah, it absolutely exists. I know some people say, “Don’t talk about it,” especially when it involves senior coaches. But I think it’s important to speak up. It’s not fair to young athletes who are trying to build a career in sports. I’ve been through it, and I know how damaging it can be.
Being a bulky, muscular athlete, we face a lot of hate. I think some people feel threatened because we have more muscle mass. Coaches and others talk behind our backs, and sometimes they even say it to our faces—that we’re “overweight” or that we don’t fit the standard image of an athlete. It’s rude, and it can really hurt a person’s self-esteem.


              </p>


              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : Absolutely. And I’m glad you’re talking about it because this kind of negativity can crush someone’s aspirations.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Exactly! If young athletes aren’t encouraged properly at a tender age, it can have a huge impact on their confidence and future in sports.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. So, tell me—what has been your proudest moment so far?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> My proudest moment was winning an international medal at the Asian Junior Championship in Chennai. We not only won gold but also broke two national records back-to-back. What made it even more special was that we had just returned from an international event in Lima. We were all exhausted and dealing with jet lag, but despite that, we pushed through and delivered an incredible performance. Winning that gold medal and setting records in that state was an unforgettable achievement for me.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! To perform at such a high level despite exhaustion is truly commendable. Now, are there any misconceptions you think people have about the life of a professional athlete?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Yes, definitely. A lot of people think that professional athletes don’t enjoy their routine. Some of my friends often ask me, “Why do you do this? You’re always exhausted, sweating it out, and struggling through workouts.” They don’t understand why anyone would choose such a tough profession.
But the truth is, I’ve tried not doing it, and I didn’t enjoy a normal routine. I need something physical, something that pushes me every day. I thrive on challenges, and that’s why I love being an athlete. Many people assume that professionals don’t enjoy their work, but the reality is, we choose this path because we love it. We don’t want a routine life—we want something that challenges us every single day.
  </p>

  <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : Of course. So how do you prepare yourself mentally and physically before an international competition? Let’s start with the mental aspect.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Mentally, I think I’ve grown a lot stronger because of the challenges I’ve faced—whether it’s the bullying or the criticism. All of that has helped shape me into a more confident person. I actually love the attention that comes with competing. I enjoy the feeling of people watching me run, the atmosphere of an international event, the crowd cheering—it excites me rather than making me nervous. I thrive on pressure, and I look forward to seeing the results of my hard work. I know I’ve put in the effort to be where I am today, and that gives me the confidence to perform at my best.
I mean, yes, there is always some doubt—questions like, “What will happen?” linger in my mind. But my confidence overpowers that. Mentally, I focus on all the training I’ve done, all the hardships I’ve endured, and all the sacrifices I’ve made. I remind myself that I’ve worked hard to reach this moment.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes perfect sense. And physically, how do you prepare right before a competition?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Physically, we train hard, of course, but right before the competition, we focus on staying calm. Visualization plays a big role—we imagine our race and how we want it to unfold. The key is not to overstress the body. We stop training when we feel good, rather than pushing beyond our limits. The goal is to feel fresh and confident going into the event.
Ultimately, every athlete’s physical preparation depends on their coach’s strategy and their own needs. But mentally, I believe all athletes should trust the training they’ve put in and have faith in their abilities when they step onto the track.


              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, how do you unwind? How do you relax and recharge after working so hard?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : I’m a very crafty person, so I spend a lot of time crocheting clothes and selling them online. I also upcycle thrifted clothes and turn them into something new. That’s my little side business, my hustle. Besides that, I paint a lot and enjoy working on different creative projects.
If I really need to unwind, I just sit on my sofa, put on Netflix, and work on my crafts. I love being alone in my own space. If someone enters my room while I’m trying to relax, I’m like, “Please, I need my time.” I really enjoy my solitude.


              </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : So, I just want to start with the focus aspect. That seems to be a big part of your mindset, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Yeah, absolutely. Focus is key.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Do you have any superstitions before a race? Any rituals or lucky charms?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> I used to! I used to believe that if I styled my hair in crazy ways, I’d run faster. But over time, I realized that it doesn’t really make a difference. I mean, you can just let your hair be and still run just as well. Nothing changes.


              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting! So you’ve completely moved past those beliefs?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Yeah, I don’t really believe in superstitions anymore. I used to have this one pair of shorts that I thought was lucky. Then, one day, I wore a completely different pair and still won. That was the moment I realized that luck has nothing to do with it—it's all about preparation and mindset.
              </p>




              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, how do you unwind? How do you relax and recharge after working so hard?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : I’m a very crafty person, so I spend a lot of time crocheting clothes and selling them online. I also upcycle thrifted clothes and turn them into something new. That’s my little side business, my hustle. Besides that, I paint a lot and enjoy working on different creative projects.
If I really need to unwind, I just sit on my sofa, put on Netflix, and work on my crafts. I love being alone in my own space. If someone enters my room while I’m trying to relax, I’m like, “Please, I need my time.” I really enjoy my solitude.


              </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : That’s a great realization! But I’ve heard so many athletes have these little rituals, like wearing a certain item or following a routine because they believe it brings them good luck. Since you’ve had an international career, I was curious if you had something like that.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Oh, absolutely! I know plenty of athletes who are really into that. Some wear the same socks for years without washing them—it's their lucky charm!

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> No way! Really?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Yes! It sounds crazy, but some people swear by it.


              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fascinating! Of course, to each their own. Everyone has their own way of finding confidence before a competition.So, what advice would you give to young athletes who are training and hoping to follow in your footsteps?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : I would say, until you're 18 or 19, just enjoy what you're doing. There's no need to put too much pressure on yourself. Just have fun with sports, enjoy your childhood, and embrace your teenage years. You don’t have to stress too much about the future at that stage.
Once you turn 18 or 19, then you can start thinking about turning professional. I realized too late that I didn’t fully enjoy my childhood because I committed to sports too early. I regret missing out on that balance. So, my advice is to have fun while doing sports and not let it become a burden too soon.

              </p>







              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes a lot of sense. On a similar note, if you could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would it be?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Honestly? I’d tell myself not to stress so much. I’m a big foodie, and I sacrificed a lot—giving up junk food, skipping time with friends, missing out on hangouts—all for training. Looking back, I don’t think it was always worth it.
Now, when I see my juniors balancing fun and sports, I realize I could have done the same. So, if I could talk to my younger self, I’d tell them to chill a little, enjoy the moment, and not take everything so seriously.



              </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : That’s great advice! Speaking of food, do you allow yourself cheat days?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> :Of course! You have to enjoy your cheat days.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> What does a cheat day look like for you?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Well, my cheat day is probably different from most people’s. I actually despise oil, so I’m not a big fan of burgers. Pizza is okay, but it’s not my favorite. But I love Korean cuisine! I’m obsessed with ramen, kimbap, and pretty much anything Korean.
There’s a shop near my house where I always go. I’ll buy a big bowl of ramen, and that’s my meal for the day—lunch and dinner sorted. I could eat that all day long!


              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing! Now, shifting gears a little—tell us about an embarrassing moment you’ve had in your career, either on stage or during competition.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : In competitions, nothing major has happened because I’m super conscious about everything being perfect. But in training? Oh, I’ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments!
One of the worst? Well, let’s just say I’ve had a few gas incidents while running. You can’t really control it, and when you’re sprinting, well… it just happens. So yeah, plenty of gas-related tragedies during training!


              </p>







              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s hilarious! Definitely a relatable experience for many athletes.Travel is a big part of your career. Do you have a favorite country you’ve visited so far?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Internationally, I’ve traveled to three main places—India, Dubai, and Lima. I was born in Dubai, and my dad still works there, so I travel back and forth quite a bit. Since I’ve seen so much of it already, Dubai feels like home.
                Lima, on the other hand, was an incredibly beautiful place. I wouldn’t mind settling there one day! I loved the people, the culture, and just the overall atmosphere. I’m very culture-oriented, so I appreciate places with a strong cultural identity, and Lima definitely had that. Plus, it’s such a clean and well-maintained city!
Within India, I’ve traveled to almost all the states, but one place that really stood out to me was Panchkula, Haryana. It’s such a beautiful area.

                <strong>Devika:</strong> : Oh, I’ll have to look that up!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> :Yeah, you should! Panchkula is amazing. The road structure, the way societies are built—it’s all very well-planned and top-notch.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds wonderful! Now, shifting gears again—what’s the hardest part about being an international athlete that most people don’t know about?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> I think it’s the standard you have to uphold. Once you build yourself up to a certain level, stepping down from that standard isn’t just tough—it can be painful. It affects you as an athlete, your coach, and everyone around you who’s working to push you even further.
Many athletes struggle with this because the goal is always to move forward, to take that next step up. You never want to take a step back. Even right now, with an upcoming event, I feel that pressure. I just want to perform better than I did in my last international competition. That’s something all athletes face once they’ve reached a certain level—it’s the constant drive to push beyond your previous best.

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes a lot of sense. Now, do you have a go-to song to pump yourself up before an event?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Oh, absolutely! I listen to a lot of Cardi B before my events. I love female rap—especially empowering tracks.


              </p>






              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Because it’s got that energy, that beat?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> : Exactly! It’s got that rhythm and attitude that really hypes me up.




              </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> : Yeah, I get that! So, would you say you mostly listen to English music?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> :Yeah, I do. I’m really into English-language music, but I also enjoy Afrobeats a lot.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, nice! Do you have a favorite song that’s always on your playlist?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Neole:</strong> Right now, I’m obsessed with Kendrick Lamar’s song Luther. It’s everything to me—I listen to it while running, sleeping, dancing, eating… it’s the only thing I’m playing these days.
