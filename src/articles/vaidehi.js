              <p>
              Vaidehi Rastogi, a rising star in the world of dance, recently shared her inspiring journey in an engaging interview with DevikaMajumder, co-founder of Global Influencers Hub. At just 15 years old, Vaidehi has already made a name for herself, performing with Bollywood’s biggest celebrities and showcasing her unique fusion style of Bollywood and hip-hop. From her early dance classes to performing on grand stages, Vaidehi spoke about her passion, inspirations, and aspirations. Here’s a glimpse into their conversation:
              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Vaidehi, welcome to Global Influencers Hub! It’s incredible that you’re just 15 years old. That’s actually my son’s age! You’re the youngest person I’m interviewing, which makes this really exciting.</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi Rastogi:</strong> Thank you so much! I’m really excited to be here.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s start from the beginning. How did your journey into dance begin?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> It all started when my mom took me to a dance session. I just began moving to the music, and the choreographers there saw potential in me. They encouraged me to participate in competitions, and once I started winning, I knew I wanted to continue in the dance journey.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, you always had that flair for dance? When did you realize it was something you truly loved?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I think I always had it in me. I started dancing when I was about three years old, and it just felt natural. That’s really when it all began.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> From three years old to now at 15, how has your journey evolved? Did you start with formal training at a dance school?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes, I did. I joined a dance school where my instructors encouraged me to participate in competitions. Over the years, I kept competing and winning, which motivated me to start my own Instagram and YouTube channels. That’s how my journey really took off.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you feel that hip-hop has influenced your personality?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes, a lot! When I’m on the dance floor, I become a completely different person. In everyday life, I might seem reserved, but when I dance, I express myself fully. It’s like I transform into a new version of myself.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fascinating! Would you say you’re more of a performer at heart?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Absolutely! When I step onto the stage, I feel like I own it. Some people get stage fright, but for me, it’s the opposite—I feel most at home performing.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Who has been your biggest inspiration in dance?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> That would be Casey Rice, a hip-hop artist. I love her energy, her flexibility, her attitude—everything about her performances inspires me.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Tell us about your unique dance style.</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I specialize in a fusion of Bollywood and hip-hop, which I call “BollyHop.” Bollywood helps me express emotions, while hip-hop lets me put all my energy into the moves. The combination of both just feels right for me.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you choreograph your own routines?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes, I do! Some routines are my own choreography, while others are trends from Instagram or choreographies by other artists that I admire.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Where do you see yourself in five years?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I want to make my mark in Hollywood, choreographing for big artists and celebrities. I also dream of opening my own dance school to train young dancers.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Speaking of big performances, you’ve danced at IIFA. Tell us about that experience.</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> It was incredible! In 2023, I performed with Salman Khan, and he was the sweetest person. Then in 2024, I performed with Vicky Kaushal and Shahrukh Khan. If you’ve seen my reel with Shahrukh Khan, you’ll notice how I was just staring at him in awe! Performing with them was an unforgettable experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How did you get the opportunity to perform at IIFA?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> The IIFA choreographers reached out to me directly and asked me to perform. When my dad told me, I was in shock! I couldn’t believe I was actually going to perform with Shahrukh Khan.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been a surreal moment for you! What role has your family played in supporting your journey?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> My family has been my biggest support system. They’ve always encouraged me, and I wouldn’t be here without them.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could perform with any hip-hop artist, who would it be?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Definitely Casey Rice! I would love to meet her, learn from her, and dance alongside her.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You’re still so young, but have you faced any struggles so far?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I wouldn’t say I’ve had any major struggles yet, but managing time between studies and dance is my biggest challenge. I make sure to finish my studies first, then dedicate time to dance.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You’re in Class 10, right? What’s your favorite subject aside from dance?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes, I’m in 10th grade, and I love math! It’s funny because math and dance are such different things, but I enjoy both.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s interesting! Apart from dance and studies, how do you relax?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I love watching movies! I’m a total movie freak. My favourite movie is Happy New Year by Shahrukh Khan—I could watch it a billion times and never get bored!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Imagine you’re teaching a dance class to younger kids. What’s one tip you’d give them?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I’d tell them to be free and express themselves. I’d also make them groove to the music first to understand the beats and get into the flow.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could organize a dance festival, what are the three things you’d ensure?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> First, everything should be organized so there’s no chaos. Second, there should be a mix of performances to keep the audience engaged. And third, everyone should just go with the flow and enjoy the event!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could combine two different dance styles apart from hip-hop in your routine, what would they be?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Bollywood and semi-classical.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! And why those two?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Bollywood makes me expressive—my facial expressions, emotions, and all of that. On the other hand, Kathak makes the dance more graceful overall.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Have you learned Kathak as well?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes, I completed a six-month course from the Lucknow Gharana.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic! And who was your mentor?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Pankaj Pujumara Ji.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How was that experience?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> It was amazing! I was around seven or eight years old when I trained. His wife, Soma Ma’am, used to come to a studio here and teach us the basics. I got blisters on my feet, and it was painful, but it was a wonderful experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! Now, let’s do a quick rapid-fire round. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Teleportation!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a good one! What’s the most memorable moment you’ve had with your friends during rehearsals or practice sessions?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> The gossip we share in class! We laugh a lot while dancing together.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a lot of fun! If you had 24 hours to do anything with no limitations, what would it be?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Eat everything in the world!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! What’s your favourite cuisine and guilty pleasure?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> My favourite cuisine is North Indian food, and my guilty pleasure is Maggi—I love Maggi!</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Maggi truly rules the world! Would you rather have a pet dragon or a pet unicorn?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> A pet dragon! I could fly around with it.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a solid choice! Do you prefer performing solo or with a crew?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I love both. It depends on the scenario, but I can’t choose one over the other.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the last movie you watched?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Baby John—the one starring Varun Dhawan.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nice! Now, let’s talk about your social media journey. How did it all begin?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I started my Instagram page when I was seven. My video on the song Buzz went viral, and that’s where it all started.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! Who manages your Instagram account?</p>
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> My mom! She’s my director, producer, and manager—she does everything. I dance, she shoots my videos, and then I edit and post them.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! How do you engage with your followers?</p>   
      <p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> I try to go live at least once a week to interact with them. I also post stories daily, conduct Q&As, and reply to comments to keep the engagement going.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you respond to DMs? Have you had a fan moment you’d like to share?</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Yes! A lot of people recognize me when I’m shopping or out at a mall. Recently, at a New Year’s party, many people recognized me and took photos with me. That was a special moment.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! What advice would you give to someone just starting out?</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Just go with the flow. Don’t stress. Everything falls into place when you find your zone. Stay free and enjoy the journey.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And if you had to give one piece of advice to your future self?</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Be disciplined and manage time well. Time is valuable!</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s solid advice! This has been such an exciting conversation. We’ll reach out if we have more questions and gather some pictures and videos for the feature.</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Sounds great! Thank you so much for having me.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s been a pleasure! We’ll be publishing this interview on our website, Global Influencers Hub, where we showcase inspiring journeys of social media influencers. The full interview will be available on our YouTube channel, and snippets will be shared on Instagram.</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> That’s amazing! I really hope more people get to see this.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! Looking forward to seeing you perform live someday. All the best!</p>

<p><strong>Vaidehi:</strong> Thank you! Bye!</p>
