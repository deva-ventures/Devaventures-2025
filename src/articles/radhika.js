              <p>
              From prescribing remedies to reviewing ramen, Dr. Radhika Priyan Garg's journey is as spicy and surprising as her Instagram persona, TikhiMirchi, promises. A homeopathic physician by profession and a fiery food and lifestyle influencer by passion, she seamlessly blends science with spice, tradition with trend. In a world quick to label and limit, Dr. Radhika is proof that you don’t have to choose between purpose and personality—you can have both, and serve them hot.
In this lively and candid conversation with DevikaMajumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Dr. Radhika opens up about living her dual life, the story behind her bold digital identity, and the moment she fell in love with wood-fired pizzas in Naples.
             </p>
             <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi Radhika! Welcome to Global
                Influencers Hub. Here, we dive into the lives and journeys of
                social media influencers—and I have to say, yours is such an
                interesting one. A doctor, a foodie, and the face behind
                TikhiMirchi! I can’t wait to hear all about how it started.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Dr. Radhika Priyan Garg:</strong> Hi Devika! Thank you
                so much for having me here today. Yes, being a doctor and a food
                blogger—it's definitely an unusual mix, but I think that’s what
                makes it exciting.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Very true! It’s a unique combination,
                and that’s exactly why we’re so curious.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> So, if you're asking about how
                TikhiMirchi began—it all started back in 2015. I was doing my
                internship as a homeopathic physician. My college was in Defense
                Colony, which, as you may know, is a major foodie hub in Delhi.
                There are tons of popular restaurants and cafés there.
              </p>

              <p>
                During that time, I began exploring the local food scene. Zomato
                was quite popular for reviews then, and I started writing food
                reviews on the platform. At the same time, I also began posting
                pictures of my mom’s home-cooked meals on Instagram. Whatever
                she whipped up in the kitchen, I’d share it on my feed.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s such a wholesome beginning!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes! And this was around ten years
                ago, when Instagram was mostly a photo-sharing app. Most people
                were posting pictures of fancy café food, not home-cooked meals.
                But I loved showcasing the food from my home—it felt more real
                and comforting. I used to post around three to four times a day
                back then!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. Consistency from the
                start. Now, I have to ask—if you could teleport to any place in
                the world right now for a meal, where would you go and what
                would you eat? Just a fun, curious question I love asking.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh, I love that question! I'm a huge
                pizza lover, so hands down—it would be Naples. I'd want to sit
                at a quaint pizzeria, having a hot, wood-fired Margherita pizza
                with a chilled glass of wine. That’s my idea of teleporting
                heaven!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like the perfect plan! Just
                say the word and we’ll mentally teleport you there.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes, please! I’m ready!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, circling back—so your journey
                started with your mom’s home-cooked food and casual reviews on
                Zomato. Was there a moment when you realized that your passion
                for food, travel, and lifestyle could grow into something more
                than a hobby?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Honestly, no. Back then, there were
                only a handful of bloggers—maybe just four or five people I knew
                in this space. I never imagined that TikhiMirchi would grow into
                a brand or that I’d have fans following my journey. I was just a
                doctor exploring cafés and sharing what I loved. It wasn’t a
                strategy—it was passion, pure and simple.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> And now here you are! Okay, the next
                two questions are my absolute favorite. First: if there were a
                movie made about your life, what would the title be? And
                second—who would you cast to play yourself?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Ooh, that’s an interesting one! I
                think the title would definitely have to include TikhiMirchi. It
                captures both my personality and the journey. So yes, I’d keep
                it simple and call the movie TikhiMirchi.
              </p>

              <p>
                As for casting—do you mean Bollywood or beyond?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, Radhika, back to the fun stuff—if
                you could cast anyone at all to play you in the TikhiMirchi
                movie, who would it be? Doesn’t have to be Bollywood, could be
                anyone!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh, that’s easy—Priyanka Chopra. She
                instantly clicks for me!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Nice choice! Love that. She totally has
                the range for it. Now tell me, if you had to pick a single
                hashtag that captures your vibe, your journey, your presence on
                social media—what would it be?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> I’m someone who deeply believes in
                faith and gratitude. So for me, it’s simple: #GratitudeAlways.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. Really reflects your
                energy. Now, let’s dig into the name that everyone
                remembers—TikhiMirchi. Where did that come from? And, more
                importantly, what’s the tikhiest thing you’ve ever eaten?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Great question! So first, the name.
                People often ask me, “Why TikhiMirchi?” And I have a standard
                answer: I need chilies with my food. Whether it’s in a pickle,
                raw, or cooked into a dish—I need that spicy kick. It’s part of
                my DNA! So the name TikhiMirchi felt like the perfect extension
                of my personality.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Love it—definitely unforgettable!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Now, as for the spiciest thing I’ve
                ever eaten—it has to be this cheese toast I had in Gurgaon, back
                in 2018. It was topped with BhutJolokia—you know, the infamous
                ghost pepper, one of the hottest chilies in the world.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow! The BhutJolokia?! That’s
                intense!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes! It was part of a pop-up menu at a
                restaurant I honestly don’t remember the name of. But the moment
                is unforgettable—my ears were literally burning!
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> I can imagine! That definitely
                qualifies as TikhiMirchi level. Now, coming back to your
                journey—what’s been the most rewarding part of sharing your food
                and travel stories with your audience?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Without a doubt, it’s the love I
                receive from my followers. Whether it’s students I teach,
                juniors from college, or people who come across my page—when
                they tell me things like “Ma’am, I loved your recipe” or “Your
                post made me try that place”—it’s just so fulfilling. That kind
                of genuine connection brings me so much joy.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so special. And you’ve always
                balanced this dual identity—TikhiMirchi as your passion, and
                medicine as your profession.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Absolutely. I’ve always kept them
                separate. Being a doctor is my career, and TikhiMirchi is my
                creative space, my passion project.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now let’s talk about challenges. Was
                there any major obstacle you faced in your content creator
                journey? And how did you navigate it?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh yes, definitely. The biggest
                challenge is keeping up with how fast the platform changes. A
                few years ago, photos were everything—now it’s all about reels.
                The format keeps evolving, and as a creator, you need to stay
                current.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Right, being flexible and capable of
                adapting.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. And for someone like me, with a
                medical background, I didn’t have all the knowledge that full-time
                creators have—things like the right hashtags, keywords, algorithm
                tricks. I often rely on my friends in the industry to guide me on
                what’s trending. I just don’t have the time to dive deep into the
                tech and analytics side of content creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> I often have to ask my creator friends or
                peers, “What’s working these days?” because the trends keep changing
                so fast.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Right! You ask around, and honestly—whatever
                you’re doing, it’s clearly working. You’ve built a beautiful,
                authentic space online. It’s wonderful. Really.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Thank you so much!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, here’s something I’m really curious
                about. As a doctor, how do you incorporate wellness into your food
                and travel content? Do you follow any specific approach or have any
                wellness tricks?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> I wouldn’t say I have any ‘tricks’ as such,
                but there’s one core principle I always share—whether in my stories
                or posts. And that is: your body is your temple. You can't just feed
                it junk or unhealthy food for the sake of trends or getting views.
                I’ve seen many creators post content that’s overloaded with cheese or
                fried stuff just because it tends to go viral.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s true. But honestly—why does cheese
                content go viral? Any theories?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Ask Instagram! I swear, if you take any
                food—dosa, sandwich, literally anything—and just grate a bunch of
                cheese on top, it’s almost guaranteed to get views. It’s been a trend
                since 2015 when I started, and surprisingly, it still works.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my god, that's wild! And also kind of
                concerning.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. It’s interesting, yes—but
                unfortunately, not good for our health. So I try not to promote that
                kind of content blindly. I always tell my followers—have everything,
                but in moderation. I’m not anti-cheese or carbs or fats, but I truly
                believe that balance is key.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, portion size makes all the difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Absolutely. I constantly talk about portion
                control on my Instagram. I’m not saying don’t touch pizza—it’s soul
                food, especially for someone like me! But just stick to a slice or
                two. Don’t go overboard.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Totally agree. Now let me ask you—what’s the
                most memorable food you’ve had while traveling?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh, that’s an easy one. On my recent trip
                to Vietnam, I visited a beautiful town called Hoi An. There, I had
                the most amazing Bánhmì—Vietnamese sandwiches. Everything was made
                fresh—the bread, the veggies, the herbs. They’d prepare everything
                right in front of you, and the taste was just... unforgettable.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds divine!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> It truly was. And to top it off, I paired
                it with Vietnamese iced coffee. That combination—Bánhmì and that
                strong, sweet iced coffee—is now etched in my memory. Even talking
                about it brings the flavors right back.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. That makes sense. Now, tell
                me—what made that Bánhmì experience so special for you? Was it a
                memory attached to it, or was it simply the food?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Honestly, it was a mix of everything. The
                preparation, the freshness—it all added up. Nothing was pre-packaged
                or frozen. I remember the vendor plucked an avocado right in front of
                my eyes. The vegetables were freshly chopped, and the bread was baked
                right there. That level of freshness is something I really crave.
                It’s rare and makes all the difference.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Yes! And when you can see everything being
                prepared in front of you—it’s like a transparent kitchen. You know
                exactly what’s going into your body.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. It wasn’t even a fancy place—just
                a small street shop. But the flavor that sandwich delivered? It was
                phenomenal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. And just to clarify for everyone—it’s
                called Bánhmì, right?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes, Bánhmì. Vietnamese sandwich. Super
                fresh and super tasty!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Amazing. Now, shifting gears a bit—how do
                you think your career as a doctor has influenced the way you view
                food and culture?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> That’s a really interesting question. As a
                doctor, I often advise my patients to avoid junk food—and ironically,
                I do enjoy my occasional fries and pizza. But here’s the thing—it
                always depends on your health profile. We recommend diets based on
                the specific condition a person has. That said, after the COVID era,
                I’ve realized that a healthy lifestyle is absolutely crucial. You
                might not have any disease right now—no BP, no diabetes—but that
                doesn’t mean you can eat anything and everything. You still need to
                monitor your BMI, your vitals, your energy levels. You can’t promote
                unhealthy habits just for views. We need to be mindful of what we’re
                sharing.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. So well said.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Thank you!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, a bit of a reflective question—if you
                could give one piece of advice to your younger self, what would that
                be? And why?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> I’d simply say—follow your heart. Don’t let
                others influence you.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Yes. That resonates deeply. I think as we
                grow older, we realize how important it is to stay true to ourselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Or even in our twenties, honestly. I still
                remember my college days—people would comment on how I looked or what
                I wore. And it did affect me. I’d feel like I needed to change,
                improve. But now, in my thirties, I’ve reached a point where I’m
                like—say what you want, I’m not listening. You have to shut your
                ears, trust your instincts, and walk your own path. That’s the key.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. I think the authenticity that comes
                with being yourself really shines through once you hit your thirties.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Absolutely! Couldn’t agree more.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, now—if you were asked to pick one
                type of cuisine to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh my god, why would you limit me to just
                one cuisine?! But okay—if I had to pick, it would be North Indian
                cuisine. I mean, dal-chawal is such a staple, right? Comfort food for
                life. Though I must confess, pizza is my ultimate guilty pleasure!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Pizza is everyone's go-to! Now tell me, how
                do you manage to balance your life as a doctor with all the blogging
                and content creation?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> It’s not easy—especially being in a
                government job. But I try to multitask as much as I can. Weekdays are
                packed, so I save my reviews and content creation for the weekends.
                That’s when I explore new places, try out experiences, and then
                create around them. It’s a balance of personal and professional
                life—and it takes effort, but it’s fulfilling.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Totally. That’s what matters—finding a
                rhythm that works.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, what’s the weirdest food combo you
                absolutely swear by—something you think people should try at least
                once?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Radhika:</strong> Honestly? I’m not into weird food
                combinations at all. I like my food straightforward—so I don’t have
                any offbeat pairings or secret cravings.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fair enough! Now let’s get fun. If your life was a dish, what would it be called, and what would its ingredients be?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh! That’s a fun one. I’d say BhelPuri. It’s got spice, it’s got sweetness, it’s crunchy, tangy—all kinds of flavors in one. It reflects my personality—there’s variety, depth, and a lot of vibrancy.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that! BhelPuri hits all the spots and brings everything together in the most delicious way.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Right? And it’s so popular—just like how I want to be remembered: a little bit of everything, but always flavorful.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Haha, I can already see the hashtag coming—#BhelPuriLife! Now tell me about a travel experience where a local food completely surprised you in the best way.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh yes—so I’m a vegetarian, and whenever I travel, I make it a point to try local cuisine. I’m not someone who sticks to just pizza or pasta—that you can get anywhere. On a recent trip to Sri Lanka, I was honestly surprised by how similar their food is to South Indian cuisine. I had chana dal curry in coconut milk, and it felt like home. The spices, the flavors—so familiar yet so soothing. I felt like I was tasting India in a different form.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that sounds amazing. So it felt like the right balance of discovery and comfort?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly! Coconut is such a commonly used ingredient there—just like in South India. Even the sambar, the upma—different names, but the ingredients and the taste were so close to what I grew up with. It was comforting in the best way.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And the best part is when the surprise is a pleasant one!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes! It was so soothing. It was raining that day, and I was having hot chana dal curry with a stew—it was pure comfort. One of those moments that just wraps around you like a warm hug.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sounds like a perfect scene from a travel journal. Now tell me—what’s one big misconception people have about food blogging that you’d like to clear up?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> The biggest one? That food bloggers just eat for free. That’s such a stereotype. In the early days of blogging, I’d walk into cafés and they'd say, “Oh, you’re here for free food and reviews?” And I’d be like—Excuse me? We’re spending time, effort, and money—traveling from one place to another, capturing content, editing, posting, and engaging. It’s a whole job. The food might be “free,” but the work behind it? Far from it.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! I think that’s such an important point—people don’t always see the hours of effort that go into creating that one post or reel.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. It’s not just eating—it’s content planning, storytelling, branding, and consistency.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now here’s a tricky one. As a doctor, do you ever get criticized for indulging in food adventures?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> All the time! People say—“You advise patients to avoid cheese and fried food, but look at your plate!” But what I’ve always said is—moderation is key. I never say don’t eat cheese—I say don’t overeat cheese. A sprinkle on your toast isn’t the issue. The problem starts when portion sizes go out of control and your calorie intake skyrockets.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So your approach to a healthy lifestyle is all about balance?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> 100%. Eat in moderation and work out. In my twenties, I could eat anything and get away with it. But in my thirties, I’ve realized—you have to move your body. Portion control alone isn’t enough. Your metabolism slows down with age, so you need to work harder to stay fit.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> But of course, without going crazy with gym routines and weight obsessions!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. It’s about sustainability, not extremes.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now share a quick tip for content creators who want to combine their professional side with a passion for social media.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Be genuinely passionate. Don’t start a blog because you think it’ll bring fame or freebies. If your heart’s not in it, your content won’t connect. People can tell when something’s done mindlessly—just clicking a dosa pic and slapping a random caption. That doesn’t work. You need to feel the moment, write with insight, and build something you believe in. Don’t rely on AI tools for captions—trust your own voice.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes! That’s something people really need to hear. Passion shows when it's real.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Definitely.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And lastly, what’s the one thing new food and travel bloggers should know before they start?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Please don’t chase cafés for ₹100 worth of free food. I see so many teenagers jumping in right after school, running behind places for two free dishes. That’s not how you build credibility. Focus on building value, not just volume. Create meaningful content. Make your presence felt by being selective and exclusive. Everyone’s reviewing everything—if you want to stand out, curate what you share and build your own unique brand.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful, wonderful. Now, if you could go back in time and give yourself a piece of advice when you were just starting out in food blogging—what would it be? I think that could really help others too, especially those who are already passionate or just beginning their journey.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I’d say—respect your own time, energy, and resources. That’s something I’ve learned the hard way. Only invest your effort into brands that understand the real work behind content creation. Even today, I come across PR folks—often quite young—who offer two or three free food items in exchange for a quick review. But there’s no sense of connection or respect for the blogger’s work. It becomes just a transactional thing—a fast promotion, not a partnership.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, like a quick, impersonal use of your audience without really valuing what goes into your content.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly. And I always say—I don’t need free food. I can manage that myself. What I want is a meaningful collaboration. And brands will only come back to you if your content truly resonates with your audience. That’s the kind of connection you want to build.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That's a great insight. Now, staying on that line—what’s one common mistake you see new bloggers making?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> That one’s definitely up there. But another thing I notice—and it’s minor, but worth mentioning—is that many new creators just follow what others are doing. I wouldn’t call it copying exactly. Let’s just say they get inspired by others and replicate the same content formats, captions, or aesthetics.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So the uniqueness gets lost?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Right. You need to add your own touch. Your own flavor. That’s what will make you stand out. You can take inspiration—everyone does—but personalize it. Make it yours.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Now let’s talk practical—can you share some tools or apps that you use regularly and would recommend to new food and travel bloggers?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Absolutely! For photo editing, I swear by Lightroom and Snapseed. Both have great pre-built filters—perfect for enhancing food shots, like coffee or dessert. They help you maintain a clean, aesthetic feed.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I've heard great things about both!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> They’re super handy. Then for video content—especially Instagram Reels—I use InShot. It’s simple, user-friendly, and does the job well. Since I focus only on Instagram and not YouTube, these three apps are enough for me. But if you’re into long-form content or YouTube vlogs, you might need a broader set of tools.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, I’m going to jump straight into a rapid-fire round with you. Ready?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Oh, okay!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Street food or fine dining?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Street food.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Desserts or appetizers?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Appetizers.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nice! Most overrated food trend?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Cheese—anything related to cheese. Yes.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, yes, yes! Coffee?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Coffee. Any day, any time.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Your ultimate guilty pleasure snack?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Pizza.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Pizza! Yes, I mean, that totally counts as a snack.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Yep—just a slice and I’m good. Definitely a snack!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Which travel destination would you visit just for the food?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Vietnam. The food there was so fresh and amazing!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Morning person or night owl?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Night owl. I’m not a morning person at all.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite comfort food? I think I already know...</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Pizza—and dal chawal too.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah yes, dal chawal! Okay. Best destination for street food?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> It has to be my Delhi.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Heels or sneakers?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Sneakers.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s a hidden talent—something people may not know about you beyond being a doctor and foodie?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I love decorating my house—every nook and corner. I have a very artistic side when it comes to home décor.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! Three items always in your travel bag?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Lip balm, a comb, and my mobile charger. Those three are a must.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word to describe your Instagram followers?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Amazing!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite holiday destination?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Bali.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your spirit animal?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> A panda.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Why a panda?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Because they’re lazy and love sleeping all day—just like me! I love sleeping—so yes!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay! Sweet or spicy? I already know the answer’s tikhi.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Yep, definitely spicy.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Dream collaboration—with a chef or a restaurant?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Always a chef. I’ve had the chance to cook with Chef Ranveer Brar and Chef Vikas Khanna, and the kind of tips and tricks they share, a restaurant just can’t give you that. It’s those little insights that really make a difference in cooking. So yes, dream collaboration has to be with a chef.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True, true. Wonderful. So which chef would you pick?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I’d love to cook with Chef Sanjeev Kapoor.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, cool! I thought you’d say Ranveer Brar.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I’ve already cooked with him!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow, okay then! Alright—what’s your go-to outfit for exploring a new city?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> A pair of jeans and a white tee.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Classic. One food trend that needs to end—I think I know the answer!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes! Anything involving cheese. It’s just too much now—been going on for ten years!</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Totally agree. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I shut off my alarm.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one thing that never fails to make you smile?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Gratitude. God has been kind to me.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now, is there a go-to song you play when you're cooking? Also—do you cook?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I love cooking! I really enjoy experimenting with new dishes. I usually just open YouTube and look up the latest recipes.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So when you're cooking, is there a go-to song you have?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I love listening to old songs—Rafi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishore Kumar. Not specific songs, just the old classics.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, yes, the oldies are the best. Now, if social media didn’t exist, how would you share your passion for food and travel?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I think I’d have started with small-batch cooking classes, maybe.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great idea—you can still start, you know!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> No time! (laughs)</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I know! There’s never enough time. So, what’s your pet peeve about food? What totally ruins a dish for you?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Overcooked vegetables, especially green leafy ones like spinach. When they lose their texture and crunch, it’s just not right.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! It takes away the uniqueness of the vegetable. I completely get that. The texture needs to be maintained.</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Exactly.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, who's your dream dinner guest—dead or alive? And what would you cook for them?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> It has to be Shah Rukh Khan. And I’d cook him biryani.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, wonderful choice! What about a food combo that people judge you for, but you secretly love?</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Chocolate dosa! It might sound odd, but I love a crispy, thin dosa with a layer of chocolate or hazelnut spread. It’s an amazing combo.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! That’s definitely something everyone should try at least once!</p>
              <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> The dosa should be hot and crispy, though. That’s the key.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, that’s the most important part! Now, describe your content creation process in three words.</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Unique, colourful, flavorful.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very cool! Now, if calories didn’t exist, what would be your ultimate cheat meal?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Pizza and tiramisu.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lovely! What’s your catchphrase when something tastes amazing?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> "The soul is satisfied." I always say that.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. Now, if your life had a soundtrack, what would the opening song be?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> "Kal Ho Na Ho."</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nice choice! If you could create a signature cocktail, what would it be called?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> "Tikhi Mirchi."</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, that sounds fiery! What’s one unpopular opinion you have about food?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Honestly, I don’t really have any unpopular opinions about food.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fair enough! Now, spontaneous travel plan or meticulously planned itinerary?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Both. I’ve experienced both, and I’m fine with either.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> But if you had to choose one?</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I love to research and plan, so it has to be meticulously planned.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Alright, is there anything else you’d like to share about your journey? We’ve covered most of it, but if there’s something more you’d like the audience to know...</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> I’d say, always be honest with your audience. Don’t brag about something. If you’re honest with yourself and your audience, everything will fall into place. The universe will help you. I’ll give you an example: a popular brand approached me for a collaboration, but they’re known for their chicken. As a vegetarian, I refused. They offered a good deal, but I couldn’t promote something that went against my ethics. It’s important to stay true to what you believe in. Connect with your audience—whether it’s a hundred or a million followers—just reply to them. That small gesture makes a big difference.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Connecting with your audience is so important. Wonderful advice!</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Yes, it’s something that’s lacking in today’s blogging world. New creators should remember that—even if you have a small following, just engage with them. It goes a long way.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. Very true. Wonderful conversation today, and it was amazing getting to know you better. You’re a doctor, foodie, lifestyle expert—the conversation was fantastic. I wish you all the best, and on behalf of the entire team, I look forward to connecting again soon.</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika. Your questions were so interesting—it really felt like a journey, a good recap of my journey too.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It was my pleasure. Take care, and all the best!</p>
            <p><strong>Radhika:</strong> Thank you for having me! Goodbye!</p>
