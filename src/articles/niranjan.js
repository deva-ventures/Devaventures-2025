              <p>
              From performing surgeries to posting reels, Dr. Niranjan Samani’s journey is as unexpected as it is inspiring. A dedicated doctor by day and a digital creator by passion, he’s proof that you can heal bodies and touch hearts—one patient, one post at a time. Born and raised in Mangalore, Niranjan transformed from a quiet, introverted student into a social media force with over 1.2 million followers, seamlessly blending medicine, music, and meaning.
In this heartfelt and humorous conversation with Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Dr. Samani opens up about battling financial struggles, finding confidence through content creation, the power of his mother’s sacrifice, and why sometimes, singing during surgery is exactly what the doctor ordered.

              </p>

              <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi Niranjan, welcome to Global Influencers Hub! We’re so thrilled to have you here. This space is all about exploring the life journeys of inspiring influencers—and we can't wait to dive into yours. Let’s rewind a bit. Tell us about your childhood. What was young Niranjan like?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan Samani:</strong> Thank you so much for having me, Devika. Well, I’m Dr. Niranjan Samani, born and raised in Mangalore, in the Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka. Growing up, I was a quiet, studious kid. My parents always emphasized education, and academics were a big focus at home. But alongside that, I had a sporty side too—I played badminton at the state level, and I enjoyed chess as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I studied at Sacred Hearts Higher Primary School for my early education, then moved to Canara High School for my secondary schooling. After that, I pursued my pre-university studies at Mahesh PU College, all in Mangalore. I then went on to join Father Muller Medical College for my MBBS, and currently, I’m pursuing my post-graduation at Yenepoya Medical College, again in Mangalore.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s quite a consistent academic journey in your hometown. Were you always an introvert?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Yes, absolutely. I was the classic introvert—home to school, school to home. I rarely interacted with people outside of class or sports. It was just me and my books. But despite the calm exterior, there was a lot going on behind the scenes. My family faced significant financial challenges. There were times when paying school fees was a real struggle. I’ve seen my mother go through unimaginable sacrifices just to ensure I got a proper education.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been incredibly tough. So when did this transformation happen—from introverted student to social media presence?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> It really began after I finished my MBBS. I realized that I needed to change—that staying in my shell wasn’t going to help me grow. Social media felt like a safe space. Just me, my phone, and the camera. No crowd, no pressure. I could talk, sing, and express myself. That’s how I started—with music.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not a trained singer, more of a ‘bathroom singer,’ as we joke. But singing became my entry point. I launched my YouTube channel in 2019, right before the pandemic. I began posting cover songs, just as a way to express myself and break free of that introversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a creative start! But when did the shift to medical content happen?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> That shift was driven by my audience. People started commenting, saying things like, “You’re a doctor—why not share some health tips too?” And that struck a chord with me. I began creating short, crisp videos—15 to 20 seconds—about basic health education. Things like diabetes care, skincare, menstrual health, and more. I emphasized that while people should always consult a doctor for serious concerns, there are small steps one can take at home too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn’t trying to replace professional advice—I was simply making health knowledge more accessible and relatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And now you have over 1.2 million followers on Instagram! That’s phenomenal. But let’s take a step back—did you always dream of becoming a doctor?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Well, like many Indian households, becoming a doctor was something of a family aspiration—especially for my mom. She always wanted me to become either a doctor or an engineer. And I was naturally good at studies, so it felt like the logical path.
      </p>
      <p>
        There wasn’t much else to distract us back then—no social media, no gadgets—just textbooks. So I studied hard, cracked NEET, and that’s how I entered medicine. But yes, over time, it became more than a goal—it became a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> You've mentioned the financial hardships your family faced, and how your mother bore the brunt of it. Were there other challenges that left a deep impact on you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Absolutely. The financial pressure was the biggest, but there were emotional struggles too. I remember my mom having to borrow money from relatives, some of whom weren’t very kind about it. Hearing harsh words about her, even when she was only doing what any parent would do for their child, was very painful. But instead of letting that break me, I let it fuel me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I carried those words with me. They became my driving force. And when I finally cracked NEET, it wasn’t just a victory for me—it was a moment of vindication for my mother, for everything she endured. It was my way of telling her and the world, “We made it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. And now here you are. From being an introvert to becoming a social media influencer—that's quite a transformation! What really motivated that shift? I know you mentioned wanting to step out of your comfort zone, but still, that’s a big leap. Was there a specific trigger behind it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Honestly, it was never just a single moment—it was more of a gradual journey. When I posted my first couple of videos, I didn’t have a clear goal in mind. I was simply experimenting—testing the waters while trying to push myself beyond my comfort zone. But what truly kept me going was the response from the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The comments started rolling in—people expressing gratitude, saying things like “You’re doing the right thing,” or simply “Keep going.” And those words meant the world to me. That “keep going” became a kind of fuel. It made me feel seen, heard, and—most importantly—understood. It’s actually the audience that gave me the confidence to keep creating, to keep showing up.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yes, the transformation from introvert to influencer is thanks to the incredible people who supported me online. I'm deeply grateful for that. They pulled me out of my shell.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful takeaway. Now that you've built this presence, what would you say is the core purpose behind your content? Is it just about sharing medical knowledge, or is there something more at the heart of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Initially, there was no clear direction. When I started, I was posting musical covers—just singing casually on YouTube. Honestly, I didn’t even know how social media worked! I had no clue what a caption should look like, what hashtags to use, or even how to title a video. I was completely clueless. But the only thing I knew was that I needed to fight my own inner barriers. So I just put myself out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first six or seven months, I posted vlogs, cover songs, and random content—nothing structured. But slowly, as I started building an audience, I began to understand how this space works. I saw potential in merging my profession with my platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        I realized that there are so many people, especially in rural areas, who don’t have easy access to healthcare or the right information. I thought—why not bridge that gap? Why not use this reach to educate and empower? I could post short, informative videos that explain common issues—things like period pain, diabetes, skin care, hair care—in a way that anyone can understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s when my content started to find its true purpose. Now, every video I post is aimed at reaching the masses with authentic, simplified medical knowledge. I want people to know when they can trust their body to heal, and when they should seek professional help. It's about awareness, accessibility, and empathy.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Absolutely. And that’s exactly why we built the Global Influencers Hub—so that meaningful voices like yours can reach millions across the globe. Now, just out of curiosity—how do you strike a balance between the seriousness of being a doctor and the light-heartedness of being a content creator or YouTuber?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> The answer, honestly, is right in front of us. I'm doing this interview with you inside a hospital right now! That’s how the balance happens—in real-time, in real places.</p>
      <p>There are days when it gets overwhelming. Sometimes I’m on back-to-back shifts, spending three or four consecutive days at the hospital without going home. No bath, no proper rest—just me and my patients. Every time there's a C-section or an emergency, I’m in the OT, doing what I’ve been trained to do.</p>
      <p>But social media is my pause button. It’s not a burden—it’s a stress buster, something that actually helps me reset. It gives me a chance to step out of the intense hospital world and reconnect with people differently.</p>
      <p>So I don’t try to balance it consciously. It just happens. It’s become so integrated into my daily rhythm that I don’t even stop to ask, “How am I managing this?” It flows.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> It’s basically a part of your life now.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Absolutely.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s how I feel too.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> It’s like muscle memory at this point. Once I’ve wrapped up with my patients and I find a little breathing room, that’s when the content creator in me kicks in. I think—“Alright, let’s create something!” I shoot a video, upload it, and get right back to my rounds. It’s this beautiful loop of purpose and passion. And it’s fun—really fun.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> I love that. Now let’s talk about something most creators deal with at some point—criticism. How do you handle it?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Honestly? I welcome it. I feel like criticism is important because it means people are paying attention. They’re watching, listening, engaging—and if they spot something that feels off, it’s an opportunity for me to reflect and grow.</p>
      <p>Of course, if it’s constructive, I take it seriously and use it to improve. But if it's unnecessary or just negative noise, I’ve learned to ignore it. You can’t please everyone, and that's perfectly okay.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s such a grounded way to look at it. Now, if you had to pick—which video or videos of yours do you think had the most significant impact?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> I’d say it’s the videos related to pregnancy and delivery—especially the ones where I walk viewers through C-sections or explain gynecological issues in simple terms. Those tend to resonate deeply.</p>
      <p>Also, anything related to skincare or hair care does quite well. But it’s the medical awareness videos, particularly women’s health topics, that I believe make the most meaningful impact. They’re not just popular—they’re useful. They start conversations that matter.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Oh, cool! And now we’ve seen a lot of singing and humour in your videos—which is so refreshing and fun to watch.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Yes! Music is a big part of me.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> So what’s one song you could sing on repeat?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Hmm... there's no one specific song, honestly. But if I had to pick one, I’d say “Sun Ri Sakhi”—an old classic, very soothing. I find myself humming it often.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, even during surgeries—especially after a C-section is done—when the baby’s born and the mother's still in pain, I sing softly. I really believe music is an actual painkiller. It calms everyone, patients and doctors alike.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Wow. That’s beautiful.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> It just flows naturally. I hum, they smile, and the atmosphere feels lighter. That’s the power of music.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s just fantastic. Now, tell us—any fun or memorable moments you’ve had while creating content?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Oh, definitely! So many. When I started with social media, it was just me, completely solo. No clue about camera angles, video or audio quality, or how to write a good script. I was lost, honestly, just experimenting and posting whatever I could.</p>
      <p>But as time passed, quite unexpectedly, I started to build a team. Today, one of the core people in my team is Megha—she now handles all of my social media. She’s been a huge support.</p>
      <p>I even went a step further and started my own production house called Techno Media Creations. Now I’m also acting in films, which is a totally new adventure!</p>
      <p>So the fun and joy really come from this unexpected journey—from being totally alone and unsure, to now having this beautiful, dedicated team. I often call them my second family.</p>
      <p>Thanks to them, everything that’s happening on my social media—even while I’m busy in the hospital—is moving forward seamlessly. They work tirelessly behind the scenes while I’m with my patients.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> That’s so heartwarming. A family built not by blood, but by shared purpose.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Exactly. And I cherish that deeply.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> They always say it—teamwork makes the dream work.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Absolutely. Couldn’t agree more.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> I completely relate to you on that.</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Of course.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Now, if you weren't a doctor or a content creator, what do you think you'd be? I have a guess, but I want to hear it from you!</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> I think... I’d have been an actor.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Thought so!</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Yeah, and the funny thing is, it wasn’t something I always dreamed of—it happened really randomly and recently. During COVID, when everything came to a standstill—exams kept getting postponed, and life felt uncertain—I just needed something refreshing.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I decided to take a break from studies and do something fun and different. That’s when the idea of creating a short film came up. My team and I jumped into it without much planning—just passion. And surprisingly, our film ended up being officially selected at seven prestigious international film festivals.
      </p>
      <p>That’s when acting started becoming a real interest for me.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. And such a relatable moment for so many of us who discovered new parts of ourselves during lockdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, tell me—what are some of the lessons you’ve learned through filmmaking? I ask because I’ve had a small role in a couple of films myself, so I know there’s a lot to pick up from that world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Oh, totally! Filmmaking teaches you so much—far beyond just memorizing lines or being in front of a camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an artist, you have to channel different emotions—sadness, confusion, vulnerability, subtle intensity. It really teaches you how to tap into yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beyond that, there's so much technical learning involved. Like, the importance of lighting—how much to use, how to soften or intensify it. The camera angles, the frames, the pull shots, the focus points—all of that is carefully designed by the direction team. It’s truly an art form.
      </p>
      <p>And it made me appreciate just how much hard work goes on behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. One thing I learned is that those five minutes we see on screen can take eleven hours—or more—to shoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> [Laughing] Eleven hours? Try several days! Sometimes we’d spend entire days just to get the tone or expression right for a few seconds of footage.
      </p>
      <p>
        But honestly, it’s worth every second. It’s a labor of love—just like medicine, in a way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Honestly, Niranjan, hats off. You deserve a whole different kind of salute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now tell me—who are your role models, especially in acting? We’ve got so many icons in Indian cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> When it comes to social media, my biggest inspiration is Bhuvan Bam—the creator of BB Ki Vines. He’s a self-made artist. I’ve been subscribed to him for over seven or eight years now, and I’ve watched his journey from the ground up.
      </p>
      <p>
        His creativity, consistency, and originality inspire me deeply. He’s a big reason I felt confident exploring acting. So yes, I’d say he’s my biggest influence in that space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a solid choice. What about in the medical field?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> That’s a bit more dynamic. I meet incredible doctors every day—some of them are just surgical wizards. Every time I witness a complex surgery, it’s like I get a mini-crush on their technique! So honestly, my role models keep changing with experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if I had to name one person, my guide, Dr. Rajalakshmi Kamal, a gynaecologist, has been a pillar in my medical journey. She’s someone I really look up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Now, what’s a typical day like for Dr. Niranjan Samani?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Nothing fancy. I wake up, eat, and come to the hospital. That’s it. It’s just work, work, work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And of course, unwinding with content creation is part of that flow too, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Absolutely!
      </p>

        Rapid Fire Round
      </h4>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Biggest influence in your medical career?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> My mom.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> First thing you do when faced with a challenging case?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Stay calm, analyze, and act.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could have dinner with any three people, dead or alive?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Bhuvan Bam, Michael Jackson, and the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing most people don’t know about you?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> I’m actually very shy. Totally an introvert.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Really?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Yep. Despite all the videos, I’m still a shy guy.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you always do before bed?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Turn off the lights.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could eliminate one unhealthy habit worldwide?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Eating junk and not sleeping on time.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Beach vacation or mountain retreat?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Mountains, every time.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Most unexpected DM you’ve ever received?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Someone once asked, “Are you into guys?”</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could describe yourself in three words?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Impulsive, dedicated, and hardworking.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lastly, if you could prescribe laughter as medicine, how much would you prescribe?</p>
      <p><strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> I’d write a blank check. Unlimited doses—because everyone needs it!</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So, Dr. Samani, what’s next? Any exciting projects coming up—whether in medicine, content, or films?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Hopefully, yes! Later this year—July or August, maybe—we're looking at the release of my next film in theatres. We're still in the dubbing and post-production phase, which has taken a bit longer since I'm juggling time between hospital duties and the film side.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re also starting another project soon, another film, so that’s exciting. Apart from that, I’m just going with the flow—creating, experimenting, and meeting amazing people along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like such a fulfilling journey. Now tell me, what’s your life mantra?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> There's this one line I heard long ago—I don’t remember who said it, but it stuck with me: "Kill them with your success and bury them with a smile." That’s what I live by.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s powerful. And now, one last but very important question: What’s your advice to aspiring doctors out there?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> It’s absolutely okay to feel like it's hard.
        Yes, the journey isn’t easy—there are five and a half years of medical school, including one year of internship, followed by NEET PG, then post-graduation, and maybe super-specialization.
        Sometimes I feel like being a doctor is like going through the Ramayana—you leave everything behind, go on a long journey, and just keep going with faith.
        But here’s the thing: If I can do it, anyone can do it. I’m not a genius. I was just an average student—and honestly, I studied because I had nothing else to do… and yes, partly due to my mom’s strict discipline! 
        But seriously—if you’re out there feeling like you’re lost, or things don’t make sense right now, just stay put. Be honest. Do your best. Don’t harm anyone. Be true to yourself.
        And if you want to be a doctor, you will become one. Just stay focused and keep going.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now tell us—do you have a memorable fan moment? I’m sure there are many from your social media journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Yes, definitely. One unforgettable moment was when I was in Mumbai to meet my manager.
        I had just wrapped up a fan meet, and I was about to head back to Mangalore. At the airport, this one fan came up, and knelt down to propose to me! I mean—just like in the movies!
        It felt surreal. I’ve always seen that kind of scene on screen, but having it happen to me in real life—it was something I’ll never forget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s straight out of a romantic drama! What a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Exactly. Absolutely cinematic—and it really stays with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> Now, lastly, what would your advice be to aspiring influencers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> The truth is—as soon as you start, someone will come and say,
        “Why are you doing this? Stop. This isn’t for you.”
        But here’s the deal:
        If you’re doing something that is genuine, that’s meaningful—something that helps people or even just brings joy—then stick to it.

        <strong>Devika:</strong> Any advice you’d give your younger self now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Oh, yes. I wish I had started my social media journey earlier. I feel like I discovered my interest in acting much later, and if I had recognized that sooner, maybe things would be very different now.
        And also, badminton—I used to be really good at it. I should have stuck with it.
        Who knows, I might’ve even represented India in the Olympics. That would have been something special.

        <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. So multi-talented. Now, just for fun—any song that comes to mind you’d like to share with the audience?
      </p>

        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> "Sun ri sakhi, meri pyaaree sakhi, ye dil kaheen khoyaa hai mera
        Jaane kahaan ise bhool gaya, nahin kuch bhee hai mujko pata
        Teri paayal mein maine dhoondh liya tere qadamon tale, sajani
        Pyaar kiya to jaan gaya, ye mushkil hai kitni
        Meri saanson mein tera pyaar basaa, aankhon mein tumheen, sajani
        Sun ri sakhi, meri pyaaree sakhi, ye dil kaheen khoyaa hai mera".

        <strong>Devika:</strong> That was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. I think that’s the perfect note to wrap up on. Thank you so much—we had such a blast talking to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Same here, Devika.
        You know, I just finished six C-sections, hadn’t eaten, and was completely drained. Megha said, “There’s this quick interview at 10 PM. You have to be there.” And I can never say no to her.
        But I’m so glad I didn’t. This was one of the most refreshing conversations I’ve had.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That means a lot. Thank you again—and all the best with your many journeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Thank you so much. And all the best to you as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> And of course—huge thanks to Megha (Dr Niranjan’s manager) for making this happen!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr. Niranjan:</strong> Thank you! It was absolutely lovely.
