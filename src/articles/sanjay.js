          </p>
       
          <p>
            <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi Sanjay, welcome to Global Influencers Hub! We’re absolutely thrilled to have you here. This platform is all about exploring the journeys of social media influencers—how they began, how their paths evolved, and the lessons they’ve learned along the way. So let’s dive right into your story, and we’ll start from the very beginning—your childhood. Tell us, what were you like as a child?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay Barai:</strong> I was a very decent kind of boy. Not overly studious, but also not the last-bencher type. Not meritorious, just average—and good with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds very grounded. How were your childhood days otherwise? What were you interested in? What were you like as a kid?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Honestly, my childhood was pretty normal. I used to go to school from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. I come from a village, so there weren’t many options beyond school. No extra-curricular activities, no tuition classes. Sometimes, I used to draw. But mostly, I just studied and tried to do well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So, not a mischievous child?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> No, not at all. Very quiet, very obedient.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> And what were your dreams as a child? Any hobbies or aspirations?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Back then, if someone asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I used to say “an artist.” But I didn’t fully understand that I was actually drawn toward becoming a teacher. That happened much later, and quite by accident, really.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> An accident? Now that sounds interesting—tell us more!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I was studying media at Calcutta University. I really wanted to become a creative director in an advertising agency. The idea of storytelling in 30 seconds fascinated me—so much creativity, so much impact. That’s what I wanted. But then I came across the school service commission form and applied randomly, just like that. And I got selected. That’s how I ended up becoming a teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, quite a turn of events! So once you became a teacher, how did your professional life unfold from there?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I started teaching. But then came the lockdown, and everything changed. I had been living alone in Kolkata for the past 10-12 years—away from my village. During the lockdown, my maid couldn’t come, and like everyone else, I had to manage things on my own. That included cooking, which wasn’t new for me because I had lived in hostels since Class 10. So I was used to doing things by myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> And that’s when Instagram came into the picture?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes, exactly. I wasn’t even on Facebook. I had Instagram, and I used to post bits of my daily life—some food, some paintings, DIY moments, wearing dhoti, things like that. It wasn’t about creating content. It was just… me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So it wasn’t planned at all—you didn’t suddenly decide to become a creator?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> No, never. But something interesting happened. People started noticing. One day, when I didn’t post anything, they messaged me—“Sanju, what happened? Are you okay?” Someone even said, “My son started painting after seeing you,” or “I wore a dhoti to a wedding because of your posts.” That’s how this little community started growing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so powerful. You were actually influencing lives in the most organic way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> There’s one moment I’ll never forget. I had come home for the holidays, and the kids in my housing complex came up to me while I was leaving. They said, “Uncle, you’re going home? Please post a video—we’re waiting!” Their mothers told me the kids don’t just watch my videos—they follow them. They make their own beds, help with chores, all inspired by the content I post.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. There’s no greater compliment than knowing you’ve made a positive difference. Do you have any other special memories with your followers?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes—one from school. A young student came up to me and said, “Sir, you always post fish recipes, but you’ve never posted anything on mushrooms. Can you do that sometime?” And he said it with such innocence, such sincerity. I didn’t even know he watched my videos! That moment—realizing you’ve reached someone that young, that deeply—that was special.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That really is. Now let’s talk about food—how did your cooking journey begin, and what’s your comfort dish?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Everyone knows—boiled rice. When you live alone and you’re short on time, boiled rice with boiled potatoes and ghee becomes the ultimate comfort food. Simple, easy, and fulfilling.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> And what do you most enjoy cooking?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I love baking. Especially desserts. Pitha, Puli, Payesh—those traditional sweets. I’d say I’m pretty good at them. I’d even go as far as to say I can challenge anyone on those!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s some confidence! Was there someone who inspired your creativity in cooking or in life in general?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> My biggest inspiration is my mother. She’s incredibly creative but didn’t have many opportunities. She’s from Bihar and studied in Hindi. She didn’t know Bengali, but she taught herself just to help me study. I remember watching her practice writing before going to the bank because she didn’t want to depend on anyone. That kind of dedication—it stays with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so inspiring. And now, in your social media journey, do you create content regularly or just when you feel like it?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I never planned any of this. I still don’t. Social media feels like family now. It’s become part of my daily life. I don’t force myself to create—it comes naturally. I don’t think you can be successful in this space if you’re doing it just for the sake of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. If you don’t enjoy it, you can’t sustain it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Exactly. It has to come from within.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> True, true… Was there a particular video that went viral or received a lot of comments from the audience? Could you tell us about something like that?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes! On Shasthi, my son-in-law and I randomly posted a video. It was just a bunch of small clips—me making pitha, painting, going to school—stitched together with a fun caption: "Who wants a son-in-law like this?" [laughs] It was light-hearted, humorous—what we call Hashyarash in Bengali.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Some people commented, “You are blowing your own trumpet.” Others said, “This is very basic, everyone does this.” But honestly, I wasn’t trying to compare or prove anything. I just wanted to highlight how someone is doing all these things—from making alpona and pitha to riding a bike—on his own. That was the intent. But it did go viral, and people kept saying, “Oh yes, we saw that son-in-law video!” There was another one too—where I portrayed a government school teacher. People often carry a stereotype: that a government teacher will have neatly parted hair, a big stomach, a pen in his pocket, and wear the same shirt four days in a row. [smiles] When I broke that image, that too resonated. People saw that a government teacher can be different.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> I think people appreciated that a lot.
              Speaking of being a classroom teacher, do you have any quirky
              habits or rituals in class?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Thank you for asking this—it's one of my
              favorite topics. I don't know if you'd call it quirky, but I’m a
              little strict as a teacher. I don’t just focus on academics. I pay
              a lot of attention to discipline and basic manners. For example,
              how students sit in class, their posture, or even how they eat
              when they’re studying outside. How to place the plate, how to use
              the spoon—these things matter. My students know this about me. I
              always tell them—you don’t need to be brilliant in studies, but
              you should know how to carry yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so important. This soft skills
              training, this grooming—you’re absolutely right, it’s extremely
              valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Especially in a government school. Most
              of our students are first-generation learners. Their parents often
              don’t have a formal education, so the kids are learning everything
              here. I remember once there were some older girls sitting casually
              on benches. I told them, “This isn’t the right way to sit.” Not
              just in front of a teacher—but in general, in life—how you sit,
              how you talk, these small things make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> You’re absolutely right. This is what
              makes you stand out. Unfortunately, many schools don’t teach these
              essential life skills, and later these same students are sent to
              grooming schools. But what you’re doing is embedding it from the
              beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Exactly. I can teach math or English, but
              who’s teaching them how to walk into an interview? How to sit,
              keep their hands properly, greet someone with a “Good morning”?
              These are basics. In private schools, students usually come
              already knowing this. But in our schools, we need to teach it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> And it’s fantastic that you’re taking
              that initiative.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Thank you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> So, imagine you’re giving a TED Talk to
              an audience of teachers—what do you think your talk would be
              called?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Hmm… I haven’t really thought about it.
              But if I had to put it in two words, I’d say: <em>Be Creative</em>.
              That’s it. Always be creative. Keep thinking, keep doing new
              things. I believe creativity comes from constant thought—if your
              mind isn’t churning, how will new ideas come?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely, of course.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Sometimes, if you see me walking on the
              road or sitting on a train, you might think, “This guy is a little
              crazy!” [laughs] I’m always thinking—something’s going on in my
              mind. So yes, if I had to choose a title, it would be{" "}
              <em>Be Creative</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. And what’s the thing you
              enjoy the most about being a teacher?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> My students—my boys and girls. I have so
              many of them, and honestly, they are my biggest support system.
              There are so many emotions involved in this job. Like when a
              student offers me a Hajmola and says, “Sir, will you eat?” There’s
              so much warmth and personality in these little gestures. Only
              teachers will understand how touching these moments are.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. So much emotion wrapped up in
              these simple things. Is there anything you find difficult about
              being a teacher?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Well, yes. These days, with new rules,
              students from classes five to eight can’t be scolded, failed, or
              disciplined the way we were. So sometimes it’s hard to manage
              them. They know that even if they don’t do anything, they’ll be
              promoted. So we have to deal with them differently—understand
              their psychology, talk to them after class. It’s not like before,
              where our teachers would just scold or hit us.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Right, right. Ideally, it should be
              teamwork between teachers and parents. Because they spend time
              both at home and in school.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Exactly. And in our case, most of them
              are first-generation learners. We have to carry that extra
              responsibility. That’s just how I personally feel—not trying to
              start any debate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, of course. Totally get it. Now
              tell us—what’s something people might not know about you? Maybe
              something on Instagram that hasn’t come out yet?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> [laughs] Honestly, I don’t know myself! I
              really don’t know what I’m going to discover next. It’s all
              unfolding as I go.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> You don't know? [laughs] So tell me, what
              is it that you enjoy doing the most?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Well, I stay alone. So I end up doing
              everything by myself. No house help, no maid. If I really had free
              time, I’d grab a hot cup of coffee and watch a good suspense
              thriller at home. That would be my ideal way to relax. But to be
              honest, I barely get any free time.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> So can we say that’s your way of
              unwinding?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> So watching a movie is your go-to comfort
              when you want to relax?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Absolutely, yes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Now imagine this—your life becomes a
              movie. What would the title be?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Hmm... <em>Happy Life</em>, what else?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> <em>Happy Life</em>—I like that!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I don’t want to put a label on what I
              should be or want to be. The way people see me—that's really who I
              am. I don’t exaggerate anything. I’m simple. I just want to be
              happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Life has its ups and downs. And now when
              I look back, I tell myself—if I didn’t achieve something, maybe it
              wasn’t meant for me. No point crying over it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. So now let’s talk a little
              bit about challenges. Everyone has them, right? Without
              challenges, life isn’t complete. What’s been a challenge for you?
              And what did you learn from it?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Living alone. That’s been one of life’s
              biggest lessons for me. People often ask, “Why do you live alone?”
              And I want to say—no one chooses to live alone. It’s never
              planned. Circumstances push you there. But once you are, you learn
              a lot. You learn to convert your moods into moments of peace or
              even happiness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> So would you say that’s been your biggest
              challenge?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Definitely. People ask, “How do you
              manage being alone?” Some can’t stand solitude for even a few
              hours. But we, who live alone, manage it day and night—through
              sickness, emotional fatigue, everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so real. So how do you deal with
              it? Meditation? Any practices that help?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I read. A lot. I try to meditate, to stay
              centered. I remind myself—if something didn’t happen, it probably
              wasn’t meant for me. Maybe something better is on the way. I’ve
              been through a lot of ups and downs. I’ve wasted a lot of time
              worrying about them. But now I feel—if those things hadn’t
              happened, maybe I wouldn’t be who I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. That’s a beautiful realization.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> I just try to stay positive. I don’t cry
              over what went wrong. What’s the point?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> So if I asked you—what’s your life
              philosophy or mantra—what would you say?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> You're going to make me sound like a
              philosopher! [laughs] But seriously, I think it’s simple—stay
              positive.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a wonderful mantra. Be positive,
              think positive.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes. Don’t dwell on what hasn’t happened.
              It’s a waste of time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that. Okay—shall we dive into the rapid fire?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> For the first time, someone’s asking me to do rapid fire! Usually I do this with my friends. [laughs]</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Great! So first—if you were a superhero, what would your superpower be?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Gupi Gayin Bagha Bayin-style! You know, they could just clap and reach anywhere in the world. I’d want that.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a fun one!</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> A lot of people say they want to be invisible—but not me. I just want to clap and reach wherever I want.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love it. Okay, ultimate comfort food?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Without a doubt—alu sheddho, ghee, begun bhaja, and rice.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Classic! If you had a time machine, would you visit the past or the future?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Neither. I’d stay in the present. I can’t change the past, and the future might upset me. So, better to stay in the now.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Nicely said. One app you can’t live without?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Right now, Instagram. It’s become a part of my daily routine. I check it every 10–15 minutes. I don’t know if it’s a good habit or a bad one. But I’m honest about it! That said, I never take my phone to class. Everyone at school knows that.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. So, if you could have dinner with any historical figure—past or present—who would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> I’ve never really thought about it, but if I could, I’d love to meet Netaji. Just once.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a beautiful choice. And if you could switch lives with a fictional character for a day, who would you pick?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Any character from Gupi Gain Bagha Bain.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, yes! That’s a classic.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> I'd love to travel and explore places just like them—effortlessly and magically.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you were stranded on a deserted island and could take only three items with you, what would they be?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Hmm… how long would I be stranded?</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> No set duration—just stranded.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Then I wouldn’t take my phone. It would die anyway. Food wouldn’t last. Honestly, I’d just go alone and survive however I could.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Tea or coffee?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Tea. With ginger. Proper ginger milk tea.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Cats or dogs?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Dogs. Always dogs.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you had to pick a completely new career—something other than teaching or content creation—what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> I’ve always wanted to be a creative director in an ad agency. But now, I feel like I’m living that dream through reels. They’re basically 30-second stories—like mini ads.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. That dream is happening, just in a different way.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Exactly.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What was the last thing you Googled?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Batik. I failed miserably at Batik, so I Googled how to do it properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s not an average answer—it’s honest!</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> (Laughs) Yeah, maybe.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what’s next for you? Any plans?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> I just want to connect with more people—to be loved and supported by more. I genuinely love people. Earlier, when people saw me, they’d ask, “Are you Sanju Barai?” Now, they just come up and say, “How are you, dada?” or “How was Banaras?” Once, I was standing at a bus stand, and an elderly gentleman approached me. He asked, “Are your feet okay?” I was confused—then he said, “I saw your video about the bike accident. You were wearing pajamas. I made a new pair for you.” He told me, “Your videos enrich us.” That stuck with me. He’s 65, retired, and spends time watching my content. I was so moved.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. So heartwarming.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> All I want is more love. No negativity—just love.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And content-wise, do you plan to stick with what you’re doing? Or explore new directions?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Honestly, I haven't planned anything. I just share my life as it happens. I don’t script or pretend. I go with the flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that—just going with the flow.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yeah, I never imagined two years ago that content creation would become such a big part of my life.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you faced any challenges in content creation?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Definitely in the beginning. Being a teacher, I have to maintain a balance. Early on, people would comment on the smallest things in my videos. That’s when I realized—people watch everything closely. Since my students, their parents, and my entire community watch, I make sure my content is clean and relatable for everyone.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right, that’s a big responsibility.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> So I always keep that in mind when I create.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What advice would you give to aspiring influencers or content creators?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Be original. Don’t copy others. You might grow to a certain level by following trends or mimicking someone—but that’s your ceiling. If you’re authentic, people will love you for who you are.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Originality and authenticity—that’s what really connects.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Yes. If I start copying others, people will say, “Oh, he’s just like that other creator.” That’s not who I want to be.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you could meet your younger self, what would you say?</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Honestly, I wouldn’t say anything. I’m enjoying this “old uncle” phase of mine. (Smiles)</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! You’re enjoying life just as it is. It was great talking to you, Sanjay. All the best for everything ahead.</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Thank you, Devika.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye-bye!</p>
            <p><strong>Sanjay:</strong> Bye!</p>
