              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Jitender, to the Global Influencer Hub. This is where we delve into the inspiring journeys of people whose grit and passion shape their paths. It’s a space where real stories come alive—raw, honest, and deeply human. We’re thrilled to have you with us today. Let’s dive in! I’d love to start by learning a bit about your early life. How did it all begin for you?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender Kumar:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika. It’s truly a pleasure to be here. Wrestling, for me, started very early in life. Back in our village, there weren’t any proper sports academies nearby. So I never got the chance to train at a higher level. But my father had a dream—if he couldn’t pursue wrestling himself, then at least one of his sons should. He would always say, “If one of my boys makes it, it’ll feel like I’ve done wrestling myself.”</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a beautiful vision. So, did you and your brother both train in those early days?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes, both of us started together. But my elder brother wasn’t really into it. He would go to the academy and just sit around. I, on the other hand, loved it. Slowly, my brother stopped going, and that’s when I started getting more serious.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Was it just the academy that shaped your interest? Or did the village culture play a role too?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Oh, the village culture had a huge influence! Mud wrestling, or kushti, was very popular. We had local matches—small ones—with ₹5 or ₹10 prizes. But honestly, it wasn’t about the money. It was about pride and recognition. The atmosphere, the crowd, the passion—it drew me in. That’s what kept me going.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. So what came next? You had the passion, you were training—when did things start to shift toward a more professional path?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It all changed in 2007. There was a riot in a nearby village, and I had gone to visit someone. My Guruji and some students from his academy were there, along with a respected coach. They saw me wrestle that day—I lost the match, but the coach saw something in me.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Even in a loss, your potential stood out?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes. He asked where I trained, and I told him, just here in the village, on my own. My parents would guide me a bit, but I didn’t have a coach. He called my father and said, “I may not train him personally, but get him into a proper academy. He has real potential. Even though it’s a little late, if you act now, he can go far.”</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must’ve been a turning point for your family.</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It truly was. No one from our village had ever gone to an academy before me. My father was unsure at first, but he saw the opportunity—and that’s when my real journey began.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ok, ok—where exactly is your village?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> My village is called Tripari, in the Gurgaon district of Haryana.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, so it's in Gurgaon. And the academy you joined—was it close by?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Not really. The academy was in the Jhajjar district of Haryana, about 50 kilometres from my village. At first, my father enrolled me in that academy, thinking it was the nearest option.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must’ve been quite a commitment, especially with the distance.</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It was. And back then, not everyone understood what we were trying to do. Some villagers even mocked my father for sending me away. They said, “You’ve sent him off to become a scoundrel,” because there was a lot of mischief around that area. So whenever my father visited, he’d remind me: “Whether you become a wrestler or not is up to fate—but always remember what the village says. Let your actions prove them wrong.”</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must’ve been a lot of pressure, emotionally and mentally.</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It was, but I was lucky. There was someone who really guided me—Jabar Singh ji. He understood me deeply and taught me the techniques of wrestling in a way no one else did. You see, I came from a background of mud wrestling, but professional wrestling is done on a mat. He taught me how to adapt. I didn’t even have the right physique at the time, so he showed me how to build and maintain it.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> When did you officially join the academy?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> I joined in 2007. And by 2010, I won my first medal—a bronze in junior wrestling at the national level. That match was held in Nainital.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that must’ve been a proud moment for your family!</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Absolutely. For my father especially—it was like his efforts had finally paid off. But he reminded me that our goal wasn’t just junior-level success. He said, “Junior is just a stepping stone. We aim for senior nationals and international recognition.” That became our target.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So when did you break into the senior circuit?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> In 2012, I secured the first position at the Senior Nationals for the very first time. That victory changed everything. When I returned home, the entire village came out to welcome me—with drums, music, and so much joy. It was overwhelming.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! What an emotional moment it must’ve been.</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It really was. That same year, I also won the prestigious Bharat Kumar title in wrestling. Two major achievements in one year. After that, things started picking up the pace.</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful turning point. How did it affect your village?</p>

      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Tremendously. Today, around 20 to 25 children from my village are actively training in wrestling. Back then, there were barely one or two. I personally helped get 15 of them into proper academies. Even their parents now say, “You did well. There’s an environment for wrestling now.”</p>

      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing—not just personal success but building a legacy.</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Exactly. They even tell my father, “Because of you, our kids have direction. Even if they don’t study, at least they have wrestling. It keeps them away from bad habits, and their health improves too.” That’s how it all started. Slowly, one step at a time. Eventually, I made it to the international level.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So tell me, Jitendra—which was your first international match?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> My first major international match was at the Asian Wrestling Championship. I was just 15 years old, competing at the senior level.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! At such a young age! How did that come about? What was the preparation like?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Honestly, it felt like the level had suddenly gone up. I kept wondering whether I’d face wrestlers like myself—or competitors who were faster, stronger, and more experienced. I thought, “Yeh toh mere se nahoga,” meaning, it would be next-level tough—and it was. The competition was intense. But I pushed through all the way to the semi-finals.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a huge achievement, especially at that age. Wrestling isn’t just about strength—it’s also about endurance, technique, and discipline. Fitness and nutrition must have played a big role?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Absolutely. In wrestling, fitness and nutrition are everything. Without them, no matter how talented you are, you won’t survive in serious matches.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Tell us a bit about your daily routine. If someone were to follow you around during your training days—what would they see? Let’s talk fitness and food.</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Well, my routine depends on the season. During the off-season, we gain a little weight—2 to 3 kilos isn’t a big deal. That’s when we focus on strength training and technique refinement, but we don’t spend as much time wrestling on the mat.</p>
<p>During competition season, everything changes. We shift focus to weight management, mat training, and fast-paced conditioning. In the off-season, we might train for 3 hours in a single session. But during competition season, a match session lasts about an hour and a half.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s intense. And what about your diet during that time?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> When it’s time to cut weight, we go on very strict diets. We completely cut out carbohydrates. Breakfast is usually just one plain chapati—that’s it. Sometimes, we add protein like chicken in the evenings, but it’s very minimal.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s some serious discipline. So when the season ends, what’s your guilty pleasure? What’s the one food you dream of while dieting?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> That’s easy—Churma. It’s a traditional dish made with crushed chapatis, ghee, and sugar. Sweet, rich, and absolutely delicious. Most wrestlers love it—it’s a reward after all the hard work.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds so comforting. Let me ask—if you hadn’t become a wrestler, what do you think you would’ve done?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Honestly, I was never very sharp in studies. I used to get tired, and my mind just wasn’t into books. So I probably would’ve ended up doing some small job, just getting by. Wrestling gave me direction—without it, who knows where I’d be?</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So your wrestling life sounds pretty intense right now. What do you do to relax or unwind? Anything fun to break the routine?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Even our relaxation is part of the training, honestly. We call it Shyam training. In the daytime, it's mandatory for us to rest—about 2 to 3 hours of deep sleep after lunch is crucial. This rest helps us recharge so we can go all out in the evening training session.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, so proper rest is as important as your workouts?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Absolutely. If we don’t get good food and quality rest, then the body doesn’t recover properly. Muscles don’t heal, performance drops, and injuries start creeping in. That’s why rest is non-negotiable in a wrestler’s life.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That makes sense. You mentioned earlier how intense wrestling can be…</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes, it's a tough sport—mentally and physically. People often joke that being a wrestler is just about eating, training, sleeping, and repeating. But in the middle of all that, we’re also managing hydration and body weight. Especially in summer, we lose two to three kilos just through sweating. That weight has to be recovered quickly through liquid diets and proper rest. If not, evening sessions become a struggle. Once I neglected that and felt completely drained on match day—and that’s when injuries happen.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, recovery is as important as the training itself. You’ve really given us insight into the discipline this sport demands. Now, let’s imagine a 10-year-old comes to you for advice—what would you tell them about starting wrestling?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> I’d say, don’t rush. At that age, explore all kinds of games—basketball, cricket, whatever interests you. That helps with overall body movement and coordination, which is crucial. Wrestling can start a little later. Earlier, boys weren’t even considered for academies before the age of 15. Even I joined late and had to spend 2–3 years just learning basics. So for a 10-year-old, I’d recommend building flexibility, doing light strength training, and slowly moving into wrestling. Starting early is good, but it has to be gradual.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such sound advice—not just for wrestling but for any sport, really. Okay, switching gears—do you have a big following on social media?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Not that big! I’m only on Instagram, not much on Facebook or other platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, and do you manage your account yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes, I handle it all myself. The account was actually created when I was in Russia for training, around 2018, I think. I was with Bajrang—we were training together, and he encouraged me to make the account.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s awesome. And now, through Instagram, you’re directly connecting with fans who look up to you. Has that interaction been meaningful?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> It has. When I get time—usually on Wednesdays or Sundays—I take a break from the regular training and engage a bit online. Sometimes I go live, or I share training insights. But just like recovery in wrestling, mental refreshment is also important—whether it's steam, massage, or just a chat with fans. It helps me stay connected and balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, wonderful! Now let’s switch gears a little—with a rapid fire round. But before we get into that, tell me—what’s your next big goal?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Right now, my target is the Olympics.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Amazing. Full focus on the Olympics then! Wishing you all the very best. Alright, ready for rapid fire?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Let’s go!</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite cheat meal—Biryani or Pizza?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Biryani.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Gym selfie or no selfie zone?</p>
<p><strong>Jitender:</strong> No selfie zone.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Most loved workout?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Deadlifts.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Tea or coffee?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Coffee.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s your life mantra?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Wrestling.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s powerful. But life isn’t always smooth. In tough times, what motivates you? Do you have a guiding philosophy?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> I believe everyone, no matter the field—whether it’s wrestling, studies, writing like you—it all comes down to hard work and patience. Nothing comes overnight. It takes time and dedication to succeed. Wrestling has taught me discipline, resilience, and the importance of living life with intent.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so well said. Is there one person you always call before a big match?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes—my coach. I always connect with them before any major event.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If a movie were made on your life, who would you want to play you?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Aamir Khan has done a wrestling biopic, and Salman Khan too—so now, I’d love to see Shah Rukh Khan take it on!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! Now a few more: Gold medal or lifetime supply of your favorite food?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Gold medal.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Early morning training or late-night practice?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Early morning training.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wrestling shoes or sneakers for everyday wear?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Wrestling shoes.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bollywood or Hollywood?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Bollywood.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A match you’ll never forget?</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> A match with Sushil Kumar. I never imagined I’d share a ring with my wrestling idol. We fought in 2018. He won both matches—but there was controversy. In one match, I got hit in the eye and couldn’t see for a while. The match had to be stopped several times, and I believe there were unfair calls. It will always stay with me.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been tough, especially facing someone you looked up to…</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Yes, it was. But wrestling, like life, is unpredictable. There are wins and losses, fair and unfair moments—but we move forward. It’s all part of the game.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Jitendra, it was such a pleasure talking to you today. Your story is filled with grit, heart, and inspiration. Thank you so much for sharing it with us—and all the best for the Olympics!</p>
      <p><strong>Jitender:</strong> Thank you! It was wonderful speaking with you.</p>
