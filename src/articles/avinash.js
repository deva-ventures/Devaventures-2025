          <p>
            <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome to the Global Influencer
            Hub! Here, we dive deep into the lives of social media influencers,
            uncovering their journeys, passions, and inspirations. Today, we
            have Avinash Sahani with us. Avinash, we’d love to hear your
            story—right from the very beginning. Tell us about your childhood
            and how your love for the army and adventure started. How did it all
            come together?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash Sahani:</strong> Thank you, Devika. I was born in a
            very small place—I’m not sure whether it would be classified as a
            city or a town. It’s called Jaipur, and we have a paper mill there.
            I sincerely believe that certain traits are inherited, passed down
            through generations. Perhaps, in my case, a sense of discipline and
            service was always in my blood. My great-grandfather served in the
            British Army, my grandfather was in the Air Force as an NCO, and my
            elder father also served as an NCO in the signal regiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an incredible legacy of service! Did
            someone in your family inspire or guide you toward this path?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Surprisingly, no. No one ever told me what
            to do or directed me toward a specific career. It just felt
            natural—almost like it was meant to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So, you instinctively knew this was the
            right direction for you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes, absolutely. Given the amount of
            energy I had and my decent academic performance, my parents believed
            I had a good chance of making it to the Indian Army as an officer.
            So, in sixth grade, I joined Sainik School, Bhubaneswar, and that’s
            where it all began in 1999.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fascinating! So, how did your
            journey progress from there?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> I spent seven years at Sainik School, then
            moved on to the National Defence Academy (NDA) for three years,
            followed by one year at the Indian Military Academy (IMA). Finally,
            on June 12, 2010, I was commissioned as an officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an incredible journey. Many
            aspirants go through coaching institutes to prepare, but did you
            have any external guidance?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Not really. For better or worse, I never
            had the privilege of attending a coaching institute or receiving
            structured training on what it takes to become an officer or a
            leader. It all came naturally to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. The resilience and
            self-determination you’ve shown are remarkable! So, after you were
            commissioned as an officer, what came next? Walk us through the next
            chapter of your journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> In the academy, those with higher merit
            rankings have the privilege of selecting their units. I was always
            clear about my goal—I wanted to join the Special Forces. The name
            itself says it all; it’s not for everyone. It requires something
            extraordinary, both physically and mentally. So, I opted for 2 Para
            (SF) and went to Bangalore, where the unit was stationed at the
            time. Unfortunately, I couldn’t complete the selection procedure,
            known as probation. It’s a grueling 90-day period, and I sustained
            an injury in my right knee. Realizing that pushing through with
            painkillers could lead to bigger problems in the long run, I
            voluntarily opted out of the probation. Completing it wouldn’t have
            been the end—life in the Special Forces is relentless every single
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I joined an infantry battalion in the Maratha Regiment,
            specifically 7 Maratha. I spent six months there before
            re-volunteering for the Special Forces. On March 10, 2011, after
            four months of intense probation, I was officially marooned into the
            Special Forces unit. From there, my career involved numerous
            specialized courses, counterinsurgency operations, and various
            high-stakes assignments. The journey was demanding, but it shaped me
            in ways I never imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an intense and inspiring path! Going
            through such rigorous training must have taught you a lot—not just
            about the profession but about yourself as well. Did this experience
            lead to any self-reflection?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Absolutely. I’ve been someone who has
            always engaged in self-talk and introspection, even from my
            childhood and school days. It wasn’t something that came later in
            life—it was always there, helping me analyse my actions, decisions,
            and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really insightful. So, every time
            you encountered someone who was better than you, how did you process
            that?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Every time I meet someone who excels
            beyond me, I ask myself, Why can’t I do that? Why can’t I reach
            where they are? That question fuels my drive. I observe, I watch, I
            appreciate those who are ahead of me, and I extract key lessons from
            them. Then, I integrate those lessons into my own routine, work
            twice, sometimes three times as hard, and push myself to reach where
            I aspire to be. That’s just how I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So, this mindset wasn’t something you
            developed later—it was always a part of you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Exactly. It wasn’t as if joining the army
            or going through special courses brought some great revelation or
            enlightenment. This has been my approach to life since childhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So, in a way, you were just wired this way
            from the start.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes, most likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Was there a defining moment in your
            childhood?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> You know, that’s a tough question to
            answer because I don’t think there was just one moment. My parents
            never told me, “You have to do this” or “This is the path for you.”
            No one really sits you down at seven or eight years old and teaches
            you self-introspection.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! You just had this inner calling,
            something that was meant to be.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes, that’s exactly it. Some things just
            become a part of who you are before you even realize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fascinating. It’s like an innate
            force guiding you. Now, I have to ask—what has been the toughest day
            of your journey in the special forces?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> I'll be very honest. I cannot single out
            one day. I cannot pinpoint a single moment as the happiest or the
            toughest. Every specialist and super-specialist course I completed,
            every gruelling hour spent in the jungles and high-altitude
            areas—all of them were equally challenging. Every day when you leave
            your company operating base on patrol, you know that an ambush is a
            possibility. You’re aware of the threat of IEDs. There are at least
            20 different things to consider, and above all, you have to make it
            back alive—not just yourself, but also your team. The responsibility
            of ensuring that every one of your men returns safely is immense.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, honestly, I can’t single out one particular day. That’s just not
            how I am as a person. I don’t dwell on one defining moment of
            hardship, one ecstatic high, or even one irreplaceable friendship.
            It’s all part of the journey.
          </p>
          <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fair. I completely understand. But was there ever a mission that stood out as the most thrilling or memorable for you?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> There was a mission we had prepared for—one that could have been extraordinary. We spent over two and a half months planning for it. At the time, the corps commander was the late General Rawat, and we were waiting for his green signal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because operations like ours often have strategic ramifications—especially since special forces missions frequently take place behind enemy lines—they require careful consideration at the highest levels. For reasons known only to the policymakers and decision-makers, we never received the green light. Had we carried out that operation, it would have been one of a kind, something truly remarkable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been frustrating, to put in so much effort and then not execute it. Is there another mission that comes to mind, perhaps a second-best?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> If I had to choose, I’d say I enjoyed jumping out of aircraft the most. If it wasn’t bullets flying around or engaging in combat, then the next best thing was the thrill of free-fall. Running towards the aircraft door, leaping out, feeling the rush of terminal velocity for those few seconds, trying to balance, trying to fly—then finally deploying the parachute. Whether it was HALO or HAHO jumps, the experience was exhilarating.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That’s something we only ever see in movies! Hearing about it from someone who’s actually lived it is just incredible. It must be an indescribable feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> It truly is. It’s beyond words. But there’s more. Another thing I loved just as much was diving. Going underwater with your diving set—it’s equally challenging, just as risky, and requires immense skill. Completing your tasks beneath the surface gives you a huge sense of achievement. It’s not easy, and it’s certainly not meant for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Not everyone can become a combat diver. That takes a special kind of person.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Absolutely. The selection process, the training modules, and the rigorous filtration system—it’s incredibly tough. If it's not bullets, then it's jumping from an aircraft. If not aircraft, then it's diving deep underwater. Every aspect of it pushes you to your limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an intense life, Avinash. A truly thrilling journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes, I’ve had my fair share of adrenaline-filled experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> And now, you’ve left the special forces. How is life for you after making that transition?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> You know, I think I was always wired this way—I don’t get attached to things in a way that leaving them makes me regretful. If I make a decision to move on, I stand by it. I gave eleven years of my life to this, nine of those in the special forces and two in the infantry. When I decided to move on, it was entirely my choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, I have my family, my job, and a different set of responsibilities. Life has changed, but I don’t look back with regret. I did what I could in that time, and now, I am here.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Is there anything you miss about your time in the special forces?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes. The only thing I truly miss is spending time with weapons and getting to fire them. That’s something I definitely miss. And, of course, I miss the camaraderie and brotherhood I had in the army.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. That bond must be irreplaceable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Yes, it is. The feeling of knowing that someone has your back, and you have theirs. Taking care of each other in the most extreme situations—that kind of brotherhood is different. It’s not something that can be easily replicated elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. It’s a kind of connection that comes from shared experiences in life-or-death situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Exactly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Finally, what advice would you give to young Indians who are interested in pursuing a similar path?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Respect your culture. Understand where you come from. Know your roots—why you belong to a certain culture, what religion you follow, and the rationale behind its practices. Once you truly understand who you are and where you come from, a big chunk of your life becomes clearer. You know your identity and what’s expected of you. Stick to the fundamentals of life—keep it simple.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don’t get carried away by the flashy, unrealistic portrayals of life on TikTok and YouTube. That’s just content for earning a livelihood; it’s not reality. Respect your parents, value your colleagues, build strong friendships, and empower those around you. Always keep learning, and never feel insecure about someone being better than you. Stay humble, and keep growing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s an incredibly powerful message. In today's fast-paced world, people often struggle with self-improvement. What’s your take on learning from others who are ahead of us?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Thank you, Devika. I believe the first step is to accept that someone else might be better than you in certain areas, and that’s okay. Instead of feeling insecure, ask them how they got there. Seek their advice—how can you acquire those skills? How can you become that person?
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s all about going out there, working hard, learning, and upgrading yourself. And as you upgrade, don’t just keep that knowledge to yourself—share it. Teach your subordinates, empower them. True leadership is about lifting others while you climb.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful mindset. Many people today seem trapped in constant comparison, especially with social media portraying an often unrealistic version of success. What’s your perspective on that?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Avinash:</strong> Absolutely, I think this is one of the biggest reasons why many people feel unhappy. They see what someone else is doing and immediately feel like they’re falling behind. This endless cycle of comparison is exhausting.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, if you’re idolizing someone and genuinely learning from them, that’s different. That’s growth. But if your focus is constantly on what others are doing, you’ll never become the best version of yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. Instead of competing with others, the real challenge is to compete with ourselves and keep improving. Now, shifting gears a little—what’s one skill or lesson from your time in the army that you think every civilian could benefit from?

            </p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> Discipline. Right dress, right time, right place, right manners. In the army, we emphasize three pillars: right dress, right time, right place. But I would add a fourth—right manners. Always be well-mannered. Know how to speak to your superiors, your colleagues, a lady, a small child. There’s no excuse for lacking basic courtesy. There is no bravado in acting like someone who is “too cool” to be polite. On the contrary, if you behave that way, you’re not impressive—you’re just being inconsiderate.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a strong point. Manners and discipline truly define a person’s character. So, what’s keeping you busy these days?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> That, along with my job. I spend time listening to documentaries and podcasts—Andrew Huberman, Joe Rogan, and The Pakistan Experience. The host is a young guy, but he brings on some great guest speakers, and I like to understand different perspectives. I recently watched something on China, something on Africa—there’s just so much knowledge out there. I always feel hungry to learn more, but of course, there are only 24 hours in a day.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s true. The thirst for knowledge is endless, but time is limited. So, what are you working on now?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I’m currently working as a Protection Services Manager for a mining company in Africa, overseeing security operations. That’s what keeps me busy these days.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like a demanding yet fascinating role. Shifting to something more personal—if you had to pick a favorite travel destination, one that truly brings you peace, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I think I would love to go to Rome.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Interesting choice. What draws you to Rome?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I have a list of places in my bucket list—places that were once great civilizations. Rome is one of them. I’d also love to visit Egypt, but with a knowledgeable guide who can truly explain the history and significance of the sites. Anything related to history fascinates me. I’m not someone who enjoys malls or resorts—maybe for a day, but not beyond that. My preference is always historical places. Hampi in India is another destination I’d love to explore. There are so many places rich in history that I’d like to visit.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. Now, when it comes to relaxation, how do you unwind after a long day?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> My best way to relax is by playing games on the computer or PlayStation. My brain is constantly active, so gaming feels like meditation to me—it helps me find solace. Spending time with my kids is also something I deeply enjoy. Whether I’m exercising or just being around them, it’s always quality time. I’m not really a gym person—I prefer running outdoors, coming back home, and staying active in my own way. Even when I exercise, my kids are around, and I enjoy that shared experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! So, have you ever had a structured fitness regime, or has it always been more about staying active in your own way?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> The only time I consistently went to a gym was for about three months in Delhi. Other than that, I don’t think a gym is necessary for fitness. It’s great for people living in European countries where it rains or snows often, providing a space to work out. But otherwise, you don’t necessarily need a gym to stay fit. For a country like India, we have plenty of open spaces. You have chin-up bars, pull-up bars, parallel bars, ropes, push-ups, bed hooks, lunges, squats, mountain climbs, sit-ups—so many ways to stay fit without needing a gym. Unless you're seeking social validation, I don’t see the necessity. Also, I’m not someone who wears earphones while working out. I enjoy my own company during exercise. Maybe I’ll listen to Kumar Sanu or Udit Narayan on a speaker, but running has to feel liberating. I can’t run with something in my ears—it takes away from the experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great perspective! Now, let’s switch things up with a rapid-fire round. One word to describe life in the special forces?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> Challenging.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Toughest physical challenge you’ve ever faced?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I think it was the stress week, or the 'hell week,' during special forces probation. I don’t even know how many kilometers I covered—day and night—it was continuous navigation followed by so many other grueling tasks. That was definitely one of the toughest phases of my life.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That sounds intense. What’s your favorite army snack?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> That’s a tough one, but I’d say shakkar para. We usually carry them on operations. They’re sweet, packed with calories, easy to carry, and they don’t spoil quickly. It’s a great energy booster.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sounds delicious! Who is the most inspiring leader you’ve met?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> That’s a difficult question. If you ask me about someone I admire, I’d say Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. But if you ask about someone I’ve personally met, I’m not sure.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fair. What’s the biggest fear you’ve conquered?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> None.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay. None. Favorite patriotic song?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> It’s from LOC Kargil—Ek Saathi Aur Bhi Tha.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful.</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I still get goosebumps.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I know. I did too. One mission you'll never forget?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> There are a couple, but I won’t be able to speak about them… because, well, you know.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, true. True. There are strategic ramifications.</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> Some weren’t even in this part of the country. So, I think I’ll just keep going.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fine. A special forces skill you use in everyday life?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I’d say awareness—general awareness. How aware you are of your environment. What’s the quotient? What are the levels?</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right. Let’s talk a little more about your social media presence. You have a buzzing handle—how do you make use of it?</p>
            <p><strong>Avinash:</strong> I make all my reels myself. There might be one or two that someone has helped me with, but for the most part, it’s all me. I’m someone who is very unfiltered. I never use a face cream, I don’t do anything that puts a different facade or layer on who I am. And honestly, I don’t intend to.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I think that’s a great thing because authenticity is what matters most these days.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> And I can carry it forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That mindset is rare. It must give you a
            sense of freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Absolutely. That’s why I’m not scared of
            anything. I’m not afraid of losing anything. I’m not anxious about
            gaining more followers. If someone watches a mundane reel of me
            doing chin-ups and finds it boring, it doesn’t bother me. What
            matters is that it adds value to my life, and hopefully, it can add
            value to someone else’s. That’s why it’s on Instagram. The day I
            feel it makes no sense, I’ll take it down or even shut down my
            account. It doesn’t matter to me.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Right, right. That’s a powerful
            perspective. Do you interact with your followers?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Sometimes. I go live occasionally, and I
            try to answer meaningful questions—questions that can actually add
            value to someone's life. I’d rather focus on guiding young people
            towards a solid foundation and mental tenacity than answering things
            like how tall I am, how broad my biceps are, what I eat, or which
            whiskey I sip at home. Less of that, more of what truly helps.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Correct. That makes sense. Have you
            received any crazy DMs or had a memorable moment with a follower?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Many times. But often, I don’t respond to
            DMs because… well, I don’t want to make someone feel…
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> If not the army, what career path would you
            have chosen?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Probably, I would have appeared for the
            UPSC and tried to clear the IAS.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much for this conversation,
            Avinash. I think we’ve covered most of the questions. Wishing you
            all the best in life, and we’ll stay in touch!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avinash:</strong> Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
