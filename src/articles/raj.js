          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          Raj Sharma, the internationally acclaimed stand-up comedian known for blending cultural nuance with uproarious humor, recently joined Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, for a laugh-out-loud yet deeply insightful conversation. From sharing the kind of stories that make you laugh till you cry to reflecting on the beauty of making people feel seen through comedy, Raj brings not just jokes but a genuine connection to every performance. With sold-out shows across continents and collaborations with the best in the business, Raj’s journey is one of grit, grace, and giggles. In this special interaction, he opens up about falling (both literally and into laughter), the timeless joy of family humor, and why comedy might just be the purest form of human connection.


          </p>
       
          
          <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome to Global Influencers Hub, Raj! It’s so great to have you here today. Let’s start by diving into your childhood. Can you share a bit about your early years?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj Sharma:</strong> Thanks for having me, Devika. So, growing up, I was neither a class clown nor a teacher’s pet. I was somewhere in between, you know? I had to be good in school—typical of an Indian family, of course. But humor was a big part of my family’s life. My dad, on one hand, loved clean, classical jokes, while my mom, well, she preferred the dirtier the joke, the better. It’s funny because, in most Punjabi families, it’s the men who are known for telling the raunchy jokes, but with us, it was the opposite. My dad had jokes like, “FedEx and UPS merged and now they’re ‘Fed up.’” Simple, clean stuff. And my mom, oh man, she’d tell some wild stories, like the one about three nuns visiting the Pope, but I can’t repeat that one here.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a unique dynamic! So humor really runs deep in your family. What about your childhood development? Were you always this advanced?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, yeah. I was a bit of a different kid. I started walking at seven months, was fully verbal before I turned one, and I could read and write by the age of three. I just always had this urge to perform and entertain. I told my dad when I was just four years old that I wanted to be an actor. I grew up in Dallas, Texas, and that’s where most of my early life unfolded.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How did your family’s journey shape your experiences?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> My parents had moved from London, and then we spent some time in India when I was a baby, so I could meet relatives and such. Back then, it was easier for my mom to bring me over to India for a while to show me off to the family rather than having everyone come to the U.S. for the visit. But everything really happened in Dallas for me. Growing up, I was pretty lucky. My dad was a huge Bollywood fan and he was actually the first person to show Hindi films in Dallas. He’d rent out a lecture hall at the University of Dallas, bring in prints of Bollywood movies from Mumbai, and sell tickets for $2, plus a samosa and chai for $1. It was his way of connecting to his roots and sharing that culture.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! He was essentially pioneering Bollywood film screenings in Dallas. How did his love for cinema influence you?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> It had a big impact. He was a huge promoter of the arts. When I told him I wanted to pursue acting and comedy, he was very supportive. My mom, on the other hand, was a nurse and really wanted me to be a doctor. She was all about the practical path, but my dad said, “Pursue your dream, son.” My mom, though, insisted, “You can do whatever you want, but first become a doctor!” That’s a story I’m sure a lot of Indian kids can relate to.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I totally get that! It sounds like you were caught between two worlds—your dad’s encouragement to follow your dreams and your mom’s wish for you to be a doctor. How did that shape your decisions?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> It was definitely a balancing act. My mom’s dream for me to be a doctor was her way of ensuring stability for me, and my dad, who was a big cinema lover, just wanted me to be happy. It took a little convincing, but I did end up going to college with the intention of pursuing pre-med. I was trying to appease both of them. It wasn’t until later that I finally called my dad and told him I wanted to switch to acting. He was surprisingly supportive and said, “Go ahead, do what makes you happy—but don’t tell your mother.”</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Haha, that’s classic! So, you switched to acting, but you didn’t immediately dive into comedy. When did you realize comedy was your true calling?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I always knew comedy was my thing. Growing up in Texas, in a town called Mesquite, which was pretty hyper-racist, I used humor as a defense mechanism. I was the first Indian family in the area, so I faced a lot of bullying. Humor was my way out of situations. I would do impressions of cartoon characters or mimic celebrities to make people laugh. It wasn’t just about getting laughs—it was about survival. But as I grew older, I realized I genuinely enjoyed making people laugh. It became my thing. I figured out by the time I was around nine that comedy was where I belonged.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so interesting. You learned to use humor to navigate tough situations, and eventually, it became your passion. So, what was the turning point when you decided to pursue it seriously?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, at 11, my cousin, who had come from India to study computers in Dallas, introduced me to Eddie Murphy’s <em>Delirious</em>. It was a game-changer. I remember watching it and analyzing it like a student watching a professor. I started asking questions like, “Why did he say that?” or “How did he come up with that?” That was the moment I knew stand-up was something I could do.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! You were already thinking like a comedian at such a young age. So, after that, did you start pursuing stand-up comedy right away?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Not immediately. Like a lot of first-generation kids, I went to work in the family business, staffing nurses for hospitals. But even then, I kept my love for comedy alive. My girlfriend at the time knew how much comedy meant to me, so for Christmas, she took me to a stand-up show where I saw an Indian comedian, Paul Varghese. It blew my mind! It was the first time I’d seen someone from my background do comedy, and it made me realize I could actually do it too. After the show, I spoke to Paul for hours and he encouraged me to start. So, I took an improv comedy workshop and got on stage for the first time. It went so well that the comedy club offered Paul and me our own show, <em>Indians at the Improv</em>, which became the first South Asian-only comedy show in North America.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a huge milestone! I can imagine your dad must’ve been proud when you started getting paid for doing comedy.</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, it was a big deal. But the funny part is, I was still working in the family business. I would work all day, go to comedy clubs at night, and perform at 1 or 2 a.m. to just a few drunk people in the crowd. But if I could make them laugh, I knew I had a good joke. Eventually, I was getting enough gigs that I had to choose between comedy and the family business. So, I looked at my dad and said, “You need to fire me.” He was like, “How can I fire you? You’re family!” But I told him, “I need to do this full-time.” He agreed, but with one condition: I had to survive on my own for six months, paying my bills with comedy alone. If I could do that, he’d support me.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, tell us about one misadventure you’ve had on stage.</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, I’ve had plenty! Which one would you like to hear about? A bombing, a fight, or something else? I’ve got a few stories. Here’s one of my favorites: there was this guy at one of my shows who kicked himself out. Nobody asked him to leave, he just decided to go. So, I told this joke, and I saw him leaning back in his chair, almost tipping over. I’m thinking, "He’s going to fall!" Then, he goes to clap because he’s laughing so hard... and boom! He falls backward, does a somersault, and then just looks at me and says, “Good night.” I’m like, “Man, nobody even asked you to leave!” He just got up and left, kicked himself out of the show.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s one way to exit! What’s another misadventure?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, this one’s from when I was just starting out. I had a solid six minutes of material—really polished. I got booked in a college town, packed with students. I went up, did my set, and the crowd was roaring. High fives, girls giving me their numbers, the works. The owner of the club was so impressed that he asked me to come back the following week. I was like, "Perfect!" But what he didn’t know was that I only had six minutes of material. And what I also didn’t know was that it was the same audience from the previous week. So, I went up and did the exact same set... and it was pin-drop silence. It was so quiet, I could hear my shoes on the tile as I walked off stage. It was brutal! The worst part? I didn’t even get paid for that set. It was a total disaster!</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, that sounds tough! So, where do you get your inspiration for your comedy?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> It might sound odd, but most of my material comes from the shower. I’m a "shower comedian," I guess you could say! I think it’s like how some people sing in the shower—well, I’m working out jokes. I’ll think of something that makes me laugh, and I’ll jot it down in my notebook once I’m out. Also, I walk my dog a lot, and that’s another time when I come up with ideas. I can just let my mind wander, and that’s when the magic happens. And my ex-wife—she’s also my agent—she’s my litmus test for new jokes. If she laughs, I know it’s a keeper. If she doesn’t, then it needs work.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great way to test material. Now, if comedy were a dish, what would your comedy style taste like?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I would say it’s sweet and savory. It’s not too harsh, no malice or vulgarity, but there’s a little bit of a spice kick to it. There’s a sweetness as well, and I think it’s something that any audience could appreciate. It’s got a balance that can appeal to a wide range of people.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! Now, if you were to write an autobiography, what would the title be?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Growing up in Texas as a Punjabi, I’d call it <em>Cowboy and Indian</em>. I grew up surrounded by cowboys, but I’m Indian. It just makes sense.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a perfect title. Now, let’s talk about your social media journey. How did that all begin?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> So, honestly, I never really believed in social media. I’m from the old school—started stand-up over 20 years ago when there was no Instagram or Twitter. Back then, if you were funny, you got booked, simple as that. But after I got divorced, my ex-wife, who’s also my agent, kept telling me, “You need to get on social media.” I was resistant, thinking it was just a trend. Then one day, she hit me with a tough question: “Are you tired of seeing people who are less talented than you becoming successful?” And I was like, “Well, yeah!” That hit hard. She said, “Well, do something about it.” So, I finally posted a joke I had on Instagram—just a random joke about playing football in high school and seeing Jesus. I had posted it a few months earlier, and it only got about 6,000 views, which I thought was decent at the time. But then I took it down, made it more polished, added hashtags, and re-uploaded it. That’s when everything changed.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, what happened next?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I took a nap for about 90 minutes, and when I woke up, the video had gone from 6,000 views to 225,000! I was like, “Okay, this social media thing might actually work.” By the time I got off my flight to Miami, it had hit 2.3 million views! That was when I knew that social media could be a real game changer. From there, I started posting my comedy clips more regularly, and it just took off from there.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! So, now social media is a big part of your career?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Absolutely. Now, when I perform, people come out because they’ve seen my videos online. It’s crazy to think that a couple of years ago, we were handing out flyers in the streets to get people to come to shows. Now, it’s all about getting those funny videos out there, and it really helps build a connection with the audience. It’s worked beyond my wildest expectations.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, let’s talk about relatability and originality. How do you balance these two aspects, especially with the explosion of content on social media? How do you know your audience will connect with what you post?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> You know, I don’t think there’s a clear-cut answer because everyone has versatile tastes in what they find funny. What I’ve realized is that when I post a video, and it gets a million views, not all those views come from my followers. A large part of the audience are people who don’t follow me, so I have to keep them in mind too. It's not just about catering to my followers' preferences, but also considering the broader audience who stumbles upon my content. For example, if a post gets a ton of traction from random viewers, I think, “Okay, this worked for a wider crowd.” So, I try to blend what my followers like with what new viewers seem to enjoy, and I throw in my personal preferences too. It’s like creating a hodgepodge of content that appeals to both groups, and that’s what I’ve found works best.</p>
              
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a smart approach! So, do you try to engage with your followers directly? I know it can be tough with so many comments, but do you make the effort to interact?</p>
              <p><strong>Raj:</strong> As much as I can. Some posts get 30-40 thousand comments, and there’s no way I can reply to every single one—it would take all day! But in the beginning, when a post first goes up, I try to engage with the first few hundred comments. After that, I periodically go back and check out what people are saying. There are times when people get offended, and I feel it’s important to address those comments. If something I said hurt someone, I’ll make sure to clarify, apologize, and let them know that there was no malice intended. At the end of the day, I’m creating content for everyone, and if one person is upset, it’s my responsibility to address it.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s very thoughtful of you! It sounds like you’re still figuring things out, even with such a large following. So, let’s talk about something a bit more light-hearted. What’s the craziest direct message (DM) you’ve received?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, you really want to know? Well, let me tell you, it gets pretty wild. I’ve had a few DMs that were, let's say, “fascinating.” A couple of girls from India have sent some interesting messages, which made me think, “Your mother would not be proud!” But hey, I appreciate it in a way. Among the more bizarre ones, I’ve received marriage proposals and requests for money. Some people just randomly ask for money, which is always a bit strange. But let’s not forget the topless selfies—those seem to be pretty popular, especially from some ladies in India and Europe. Then, there’s the unique case of a woman who messaged me after one of my shows in Delhi. She was like, "Next time you’re back, let me know and I’ll meet you at the hotel." I didn’t think much of it at first until she correctly guessed which hotel I was staying at, which was a little unsettling. She then said, “We can meet at the bar, or I can bring the bar room to you.” Now, that was a solid line! I had to give her props for that one. It’s not every day someone gets the art of flirtation right.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wow, that’s definitely an interesting mix! Now, let’s talk about your visits to India. How often do you come here?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I’ve been visiting India regularly since 2013. From 2013 to 2017, I used to come here every year for several months. People are often surprised to hear that I speak both Hindi and Punjabi fluently, so when I first came to India, I was able to perform in both languages. It actually surprised a lot of people, and that helped me get more bookings. I also worked closely with Vir Das—we did a show together for Amazon, called Destination Unknown —which was a great experience. Then, COVID hit, and that threw everything off track. I heard some people had trouble leaving India because of quarantine rules, so I decided to take a break. But now that things are easing up, I plan to come back. I’ve got a new special coming out in January in the States, and it’ll be global. The plan is to return to India around March or April, when the weather is still manageable, and tour again.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds exciting! Now, tell us a little about your acting career.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I was signed with CBS for a year, which was a lot of fun. I’ve done a few independent films and projects here and there. But these days, my main focus is on stand-up comedy, especially with social media picking up steam. As my online presence grows, I plan to expand into acting more seriously as well. I’ve got a full team behind me now, with an acting agent, a commercial agent, and a stand-up comedy agent, all through Gersh. They’ll help me find the right balance between stand-up and acting, so that’s the plan moving forward.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible! So, speaking of agents, didn’t you mention your ex-wife was your agent?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes, that’s right! My ex-wife is my comedy agent. She’s the one who helped me build my team, so I’m forever grateful to her for that. She’s a big part of why things are going so well for me right now.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s really interesting! So, what advice would you give to someone who aspires to follow in your footsteps?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Russell Peters once told me something that really stuck with me: “It’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon.” A lot of people see success stories and think it happens overnight, but what they don’t see is all the hard work behind the scenes. Even my dear friends, like Danny Fernandez, Aditi Mittal, and Ahmed Dandam—they’ve all been at it for years before becoming household names. The key is consistency and dedication. My advice? Don’t quit your day job too soon. Keep doing what pays the bills while you pursue your dreams. Over time, you’ll figure out how to balance both. And when you do find success, remember to save some money. Show business isn’t just about performing; there’s a lot of behind-the-scenes logistics, like travel costs and accommodation. If you can manage those, you’ll be much more successful in the long run. But above all, stay passionate about what you do, and if you put in the work, you’ll eventually see results.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, what about 10-year-old Raj? If you could go back and tell him that he’d become a successful stand-up comedian, what do you think his reaction would be?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my gosh! I say this all the time—if you had told 10-year-old Raj that I’d be a successful comedian today, he would’ve lost his mind! But honestly, there would have been that little voice in the back of his head going, "I told you so. I knew I was gonna do this." It’s crazy to think about!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really cool! So, you already knew it was in you?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I remember this moment so clearly. My dad and I were sitting in the living room of our apartment in Pleasant Grove, Texas. He was watching Amitabh Bachchan, and for some reason, he always wore these short pants around the house. I was four years old, and I remember pulling on his shorts and telling him, "I’m gonna do that one day." And he said, "You’re gonna be a police officer or a smuggler." And I looked at him and said, "No, I’m gonna be an actor. Or better yet, I’m gonna make people laugh." I remember that moment like it was yesterday.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s such a powerful memory! And look where you are now. So, how about giving us a couple of quick one-liners that’ll leave our audience in splits?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, most of my one-liners are pretty, let’s just say, "dirty." (laughs) But here’s one that I always thought was funny: I was watching a documentary about people who handle tragedy in remarkable ways. There was this lady in Sri Lanka who named her baby "Tsunami" because he was born when the first wave hit the island. And I thought, that’s crazy. But then I thought, one day, that kid is going to get lost at the beach!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) That’s hilarious, but also so clever! Got any more? Or are they all on the edgier side?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, some of them are a bit too... let’s say, "naughty" for this audience. But there’s one joke that my mom absolutely loves—it’s on YouTube and Instagram. I’ve been warned by her not to air it on any family-friendly platforms, but when you hear it, you’ll be like, "I can’t believe this is coming from Auntie!" My dad’s got his own style too. He always cracks this joke about FedEx and UPS merging to become "Feda." (laughs) It’s the funniest thing, and that’s the kind of humor I grew up with.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughing) Oh, I’ve got to hear this joke about the nuns now! Can you give us a hint?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, definitely. If you ever message me about it, I’ll send you the full version. Just know it’s... very spicy! (laughs) You’ll be shocked when you hear it, trust me. My mom was a small, five-foot-three Punjabi nurse, and this joke... Well, let’s just say it was her favorite, and I have no idea how she found it so funny.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) That sounds like a treasure trove of comedy! Let’s switch gears a bit—let’s go for a rapid-fire round. Ready?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Bring it on!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> First joke you ever cracked?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Ah, that’s a tough one. But I remember this one incident from school. There was a lot of racism in my small town, Mesquite, Texas, and a kid came up to me once and said, "Hey, Raj, where did you park your camel?" Without missing a beat, I said, "Last time I saw it, your mom and dad were on it. So, if you can tell them to bring it back, that’s my only way home." The kid didn’t know what to say. I just walked away like I had won a silent victory. (laughs)</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughing) That’s brilliant! And who was your favorite comedian growing up?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I’ve always been a fan of Johnny Carson and Dennis Wolfberg. Dennis was an amazing comic—he was a New York City school teacher before he became a comedian. He had this fantastic joke about his wife going to the bathroom so much during pregnancy that she was basically qualifying for federal assistance for a flood! (laughs) I loved his humor. Jim Carrey and Eddie Murphy were also huge influences on me. And then, you’ve got these awesome comics like Henry Cho, who was a Korean guy from Tennessee. His humor was unique—just like him!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s so interesting how so many comedians have such diverse backgrounds. Speaking of diversity, what’s the most embarrassing childhood memory you have?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh man, every Indian kid has been through this. When you tell your parents you want to go into entertainment, they always make you perform at every family gathering. My parents would throw these dinner parties, and next thing you know, I was being forced to sing or dance in front of all these drunk relatives. And I was like, "No, please, not again!" But you don’t have much of a choice. I was, like, nine years old, shaking my hips while all the uncles and aunties watched. Totally embarrassing!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughing) That’s such a classic! Every kid in India has had that moment. So, who was your biggest supporter growing up? Your mom or your dad?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Definitely my dad when it came to the arts. He was always there for me. If I did a drama in school or college, he didn’t miss a single performance. But my mom... she was supportive in her own way. There was one time I was struggling financially, and I didn’t have much money. My mom made this incredible Raj Machaba, Roti, and Alu Gobi for me, and when I went to pick it up, there were three $20 bills tucked at the bottom of the bag with a note that said, "Buy groceries, don’t tell your dad." She always had my back.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a sweet and thoughtful gesture. So, if you weren’t a comedian, what do you think you would have been?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, easy—I would have been a cardiothoracic surgeon. I actually wanted to go into medicine, but the world of comedy kind of pulled me in. Maybe in another life, I’d be saving lives instead of cracking jokes!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Your childhood crushes—real or Bollywood?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh my god, Rekha. How could you not love her? I mean, real crushes aside, Rekha was the bee's knees. And it’s so funny because I was such a huge fan of hers, and to this day, I still am. One of the coolest things is that she follows me on social media. Tabu, too—she likes my posts and comments, and I feel like a total fangirl when I see that. And speaking of meeting people, I once met Manisha Koirala here in Dallas. She used to live here, though I think she’s back in India now. She was attending a fashion show that I performed at, and after the show, I was at the bar and didn’t even realize she was standing next to me. Later, we ended up in the same elevator, and she told me, “You’re really good. I’m such a fan.” That was a surreal moment for me.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That's amazing! Now, tell me, who was your childhood crush?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, back in the day, there was this girl named Melissa. And man, I couldn’t beat that crush. But, you know, we all had that one crush back in the day.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s great! Moving on, if you could have any superpower as a kid, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> To fly, no question. I’d travel the world instead of being stuck in Mesquite, Texas. Imagine how different things would’ve been if I could just fly anywhere.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a good one! Now, comedy or acting—pick one.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Comedy. Definitely. I always knew it was the one for me. I mean, acting is great, but comedy is where my heart truly lies.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You’ve definitely made your mark in comedy. Speaking of which, what’s the best stage moment you’ve had?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Performing for Shabana Azmi was a huge highlight. I did my Amitabh Bachchan joke where I talked about how, as we grow older, our heroes grow older too. I mentioned how, in 1993, Amitabh was shot four times in Agneepath, only to die from constipation in Piku 21 years later. Shabana Azmi was there, and she burst out laughing. That moment felt incredible. Another one of my favorite moments was when my mom came to see me perform with 16 of her friends. After the show, I pointed her out in the audience and said, “That’s my mom.” And she waved back, shouting, “I used to beat him!” like she was the queen of England. It was hilarious, and I think it’s something I’ll always cherish. It was also the last time she got to see me perform before she passed away in 2012.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a beautiful and heartwarming moment. Now, is there one joke you’re particularly proud of?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh, definitely. My Jesus football joke. It’s based on a real incident when I was getting bullied in school, and I thought joining the football team would help. But it turned out to be a terrible idea. The first time I got hit, I saw Jesus—which, I mean, for my teammates was fine, but I’m Hindu! Do you realize how hard you have to be hit to see someone else’s god? That joke went viral, and it's probably the one everyone associates with me. If I don’t perform it at a show, people actually call me out for it.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I’m sure that joke has become iconic! So tell me—what's one thing that always makes you laugh, no matter what?</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> People falling down. I know it’s awful, but it’s true.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That is true. I mean, it sounds like there's depth there...</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> No, not really. It’s just... you fall, I laugh. I mean, I’ll extend a hand to help, but after I’ve had my laugh. I say this all the time—those first five to ten seconds? Hysterical laughter. Then I help.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, basically, you're laughing and helping at the same time?</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Exactly. I’ll ask, “Are you okay?” while I’m still wheezing. But yeah—friends, strangers, anyone. If they fall, I just can’t not laugh. That’s my humor in a nutshell.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so specific, I love it. I remember when I was in Boston and it snowed... I think it was my freshman year. This guy—who I think had a crush on me—was standing there talking to me. Not even walking. Just standing. And he fell.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Oh no…</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Just like that. It was over. I couldn’t look at him the same again.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Of course! In that moment, he knew he’d ruined it. There’s no bouncing back from that.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! I mean, if he were walking, I could’ve understood—ice, snow, whatever. But no, he was standing still. And then he fell.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah, he must’ve gotten up thinking, “Well, that’s the end of that romantic chapter.” Can’t really stand up after that and ask you to dinner.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right? Like, I don’t want to go eat with someone who just defied physics. I’d be cracking jokes the whole evening.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> “I hope you don’t fall into your soup,” kind of jokes?</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! My laughter’s also super loud. Like, I laugh with my whole being—none of that hiding behind your hand business.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Same. I mean, the poor guy. But hey, maybe he's a professor now?</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, he is! Somewhere in the U.S.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I hope it’s not physics, because gravity has not been kind to him.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> <em>Laughs</em> Nope, it’s chemistry, thank god.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> See? You're a natural comic. There’s your first two minutes of stage material right there.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> In India, we have this word— <em>Kore</em> —which means “the beginning” or “where it all starts.” That moment? That fall? Kore.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Beautiful. I’ll take full credit when your comedy career launches.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> My sister’s the real mimic in the family though. She keeps doing impressions of me, and honestly, I tell her all the time—I’m your content!</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Well, give her this story. I think she’ll kill with it.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, changing gears—if you could tell one joke for the rest of your life, what would it be?</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> My mom’s nun joke. It’s so good. Hilarious, a little filthy, and absolutely fabulous. It deserves to be heard forever.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You have to send it to me!</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I will, I will. I don’t think people would want to hear it every single day—but I would be happy to.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, next big question—what’s the future for Raj Sharma, the comedian?</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Honestly? I just want to keep going until the end. Keep making people laugh, keep spreading joy, travel the world, and come back to India more often.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You've performed in India before, right?</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yeah! First time was in 2013. We did 16 shows—and all of them were sold out. The last few shows I did were part of Destination Unknown on Amazon, with Veer. We did shows in Jodhpur and Ladakh. Incredible experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing. And truly, I think it’s something people need now more than ever—just a reason to laugh.</p>

          <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Exactly. Everyone’s got a phone and a million reasons to be stressed out. Comedy is medicine. And in India, you guys are blessed with a treasure trove of talent—Amit Tandon, Jeeveshu Ahluwalia, Anshu Mor, Daniel Fernandez, Veer Das, Papa CJ… and the amazing women like Aditi Mittal and Neeti Palta. Look them all up.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And of course—look up Raj Sharma.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Yes! Please do. I’m an attention junkie too, so it works out.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, dream collab time. Who would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Johnny Lever. Hands down. That man is a legend. There’s nothing he can’t do.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Iconic choice.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Back in the day, there was Mehmood, but Johnny Lever today is just… the best. I've been lucky to work with so many amazing people—Dave Chappelle, Sebastian Maniscalco, Matt Rife—heck, I used to buy Matt dinner because he was broke! But Johnny? That would be a dream.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You’ve really seen it all.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> I’ve had my share. But hey, Raj with Raj? That’s a collab I wouldn’t mind either.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Honestly, same. That would be a killer show. This has been so much fun, Raj.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Seriously—I don’t say this lightly—but this is probably one of the best interviews I’ve done in the last ten years. Just pure fun and easy.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That means a lot! And same here—I think this might be one of my favorite conversations.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Thank you for everything. This was amazing.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you. Keep shining, Raj. Keep making us laugh.</p>
            <p><strong>Raj:</strong> Will do. Goodnight!</p>
