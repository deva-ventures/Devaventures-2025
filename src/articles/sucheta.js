              Sucheta Deb Burman, an accomplished open water swimmer and advocate for environmental sustainability, recently shared her remarkable journey in a candid conversation. From her childhood in Bangalore, where swimming became a way of life under the guidance of her father, to her transition from the corporate world back into the competitive swimming arena, Sucheta's story is one of passion, perseverance, and purpose. During her conversation with Devika Majumder, she reflects on the challenges she's overcome, the mental fortitude required for her sport, and the significant role her foundation plays in preserving open waters. Here’s a glimpse into their engaging conversation.

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sucheta. Welcome to Global Influencers Hub. Here, we talk about the life journeys of social media influencers, and we’re excited to dive into yours.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta Deb Burman:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika! I’m really happy to be here. You know, I just heard from you, and I thought, wow, you guys have been around for a very long time, and there are some phenomenal athletes online. I’m excited to share my journey.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’re definitely looking forward to hearing all about it. So, let's start with your childhood. Where were you born, and how did swimming become a part of your life?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> It’s something I love sharing over and over again. My dad is my coach, and he taught me how to swim. I’ve been swimming since I was 4 years old. Growing up, being in the water at such a young age, and having my dad, a senior coach, guide me—it naturally led me into competitive swimming. From there, I moved into the corporate world before returning to open water swimming, which is a completely different space to be in. It wasn’t easy initially to balance the father-daughter, coach-student dynamic, but we’ve figured it out over time.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! It must have been special to have your father so involved in your journey. Was swimming always something that drew you in, or was it more of a natural progression?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Honestly, I’ve always been drawn to water. The pool I used to swim in, which is called the Swimming Pool in Bangalore, is 75 years old this year! It’s right by a lake, and we would go there in the evenings, witnessing the sunset, just enjoying the beauty of it. Those moments—being in the water, pushing myself as a child—instilled so much in me, like discipline, hard work, and sportsmanship. I wake up at 4 a.m. every day, ready to go to the pool because that discipline is ingrained in me.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s amazing how that discipline shapes you for life. Were there any moments of fear or hesitation along the way? And if so, how did you overcome them?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> The biggest fear I’ve had to overcome is swimming in the dark. It’s a process, and I’m still working on it. I’ve only done four swims so far in the dark, but each time, I feel myself overcoming the fear a little more. It's something I’m still facing, but I know I’ll conquer it eventually.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s inspiring that you’re facing that fear head-on. Now, let’s talk about your foundation, the Open Water Swimmers Foundation. Can you tell us more about it?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Absolutely. The foundation means everything to me and my team. It started when we noticed people throwing bottles and plastic into lakes while we were swimming. The tradition of immersing idols in water during festivals also contributes to pollution. We decided to take action—cleaning up the lakes and raising awareness. We’ve partnered with the Swimming Federation of India, and the recognition we’re getting has been amazing. It’s all about taking responsibility for the space we swim in and preserving it for future generations.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a noble cause! It’s incredible how your passion for swimming is linked to environmental conservation. How is the foundation’s impact evolving?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> It’s going brilliantly. We’ve had the honor of being a part of two events with the Swimming Federation of India, and more people are recognizing what we’re doing. The foundation is nonprofit, and it’s not just about cleaning the water. It’s about educating others to respect the environment and take action.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love the intent behind it. Now, let’s talk about mental preparation before a swim. Of course, the physical aspect is key, but the mental preparation must be just as crucial. Can you walk us through how you prepare mentally before a swim?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Mental preparation is everything. When I train in the pool, it’s about endurance and speed. You spend endless hours going back and forth, flipping and swimming. It trains your body, but it also trains your mind. I’ve learned how to handle the monotony, knowing that there will be breaks, but you keep going. Mentally, you’re preparing for what’s ahead—pushing through the discomfort. You also have to trust your crew, especially in open water, because they’re the ones who keep you safe and give you the support you need.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds intense. And in terms of rituals or quirky habits, do you have anything you do before a competition or a swim?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> I always get a little nervous before a swim, no matter how prepared I am. There’s always a bit of uncertainty, but I find comfort in my team. My crew is integral to my success—whether it’s in the pool or the open water. Knowing that they’re watching out for me makes all the difference. It’s the people around you that help make the journey possible.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s so important to have that support. Now, tell me about your schooling and college years. How did they influence your journey?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> I went to Baldwin Girls High School in Bangalore, then to Saint Joseph’s Arts and Science College. I did industrial relations, economics, and sociology there. I’ve been fortunate to reconnect with my professors through alumni events, and it’s been wonderful to see how far I’ve come since then. I also did my master’s in commerce at Saint Joseph’s College of Commerce. It’s a great feeling to reconnect with the people who saw me grow up.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. So, while you were pursuing your education and swimming, did you ever consider swimming a profession or was it more of a passion that turned into a profession later on?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Initially, I was swimming for school, then college, and of course, life happened. There was a phase when I entered the corporate world, and I even injured my back. But after recovering, I found myself drawn back to swimming. I never saw it as just a passion—it was something that became part of me. When COVID hit, everything changed, and I found myself reflecting on what I truly loved to do. Sometimes, it takes moments like that to realize that you can always go back to what you’re passionate about, no matter the circumstances.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s so inspiring to see how your journey unfolded. You’re living proof that it’s never too late to follow your passion.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Exactly. If something moves you, just go for it. Don’t be afraid to make sacrifices or let go of things that aren’t aligned with your true calling. It’s never too late to pursue what you love.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! So what do you think was your most memorable swim so far?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Every swim I do, every day I'm in the water, every stroke, every breath—they’re all memorable because it’s every second of my life. I’m not wasting it away; I’m doing something purposeful, something that matters deeply to me. Of course, there have been failures—a couple of failed swims—but I see them as opportunities to learn. Yes, I’ve sulked for a while, but ultimately, I ask myself, “What did I learn from this?” Over time, these experiences help me grow. They’re about introspection and becoming better—not just for myself but for the people around me. If you can only do good, then do good. Don’t harm anyone. Words can hurt, but at the end of the day, it’s sticks and stones, you know?</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love how you’re talking so much about introspection. It’s such a valuable message in every phase of life, especially during failures.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Absolutely. I’ve always seen failures as learning phases. When we’re pursuing our dreams, nothing is truly a failure; it’s just another opportunity to learn. But introspection is the key. The times are changing so quickly, and the human touch, humility—they’re becoming rare. It’s important to tell people it’s okay to fail. Everyone deals with it differently, and that’s fine. Social media tells you to meditate or do yoga, but you need to find what works for you. It’s your journey.</p>
            <p>I’ve tried different things myself—group therapy classes, reading, experimenting with techniques. There’s no harm in trying because someone’s words or perspective might ignite something within you that you didn’t even realize was dormant.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important takeaway. So, what has this entire experience taught you? How has it changed your outlook on life?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Oh, it has been humbling. We are so minuscule—just tiny specks in the vastness of the sea, the universe. When you’re out there in the water, you realize how small you are. It’s mind-boggling. But it also teaches you appreciation, humility, and gratitude. There’s so much life around you, so much to learn and look forward to. It’s like a sudden epiphany, a realization of things you never thought you’d understand. The vastness of the water puts everything into perspective.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds profound. What would your advice be to someone pursuing a similar path?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Be a better person every day. Whether it’s your swimming technique or your mindset, keep improving. Always keep an open mind. If you’re seeking a coach, there’s a reason they’re the coach and you’re the student. Respect their experience and ask questions. Asking questions is so important, and no question is ever a dumb question. It takes courage to ask, and it’s how you grow.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> How do you stay calm and composed in the vastness of the water? Is there a mind trick to it?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> (laughs) Oh, no, no tricks. I have my moments of anger too. Sometimes I’m out there thinking, “What am I doing?” It can get monotonous and lonely, and your mind starts wandering—to conversations you’ve had, things you should have said. But then you’re reminded of the peaceful moments, the fun nights, the lovely meals. The water gives you so much time to introspect. It’s a range of emotions—anger, joy, reflection. It’s quite therapeutic and meditative.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Have you ever thought about giving up? What kept you going?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Oh, yes, there have been moments of doubt. This is a lonely sport; you’re alone with your thoughts most of the time. There were times I wondered why I kept doing it. But it’s not about giving up; it’s about understanding when to give your body and mind a break. I went back-to-back for three years without stopping, and it took a toll. I’ve taken an 18-month break since my last swim in March, and I’ve been healing mentally, physically, and emotionally. Breaks are necessary, and I feel I’ve earned it. But no, I’ll never give up. It’s a love that I can’t let go of.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love how your passion shines through. So, when you’re not in the water, what does a day in your life look like?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> I love cooking! I’m also a homebody, so I enjoy making my space cozy. I spend time with my pet, Lola. We have this game called “cuddle monkey,” where I catch her and cuddle her. I also work out twice a day, either swimming or weight training, and I do a lot of physiotherapy for injuries. Honestly, I love being at home.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s lovely! What about nutrition? Any comfort food you love?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Oh, biryani. Anytime, anywhere! There’s something about biryani that’s just so happy and comforting. It’s my soul food. It’s like Chinese food for some people—just pure joy.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I can totally relate! For me, it’s Indian Chinese food. When I was pregnant, I even traveled back to India just to have it. There’s nothing like it.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> (laughs) Exactly! Food has this amazing ability to bring joy. It’s like a universal love language.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So is there a life mantra for you when the going gets tough or just in general? Like, do you have, you know, a philosophy of life or your life mantra?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Good question. My mantra is simple: “Don’t carry baggage.” You can’t wake up in the morning thinking about things that weigh you down. I sleep early—by 8:15 or 8:30, I’m out. If I wake up at 4 a.m. brooding over something, I won’t sleep again. So I just let things go. It makes you feel lighter.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a healthy mindset!</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> I know, but it’s not always easy. Lately, I’ve also adopted something I call “sticks and stones.” You go through so much in life and meet so many people. It’s like the saying—sticks and stones may break my bones, but words won’t hurt me anymore. You reach a point where you realize you can’t keep brooding over should’ve, could’ve, would’ve. Life moves on.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true! It’s tough, but making that conscious choice makes all the difference.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> It’s so important. Bad sleep, bad thoughts, or a negative environment can ruin my day, my training, and my mindset. I’ve learned to cut through the noise and prioritize my peace.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now, if you could swim with one celebrity, who would it be and why?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Fun question! Maybe Nicole Kidman. Does she even swim? I don’t know. (laughs)</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that! You should tag her!</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> (laughs) Definitely! And Louis Pugh. He’s incredible—swimming in freezing waters like 4 degrees Celsius, doing 100 miles, 50 miles. He’s someone I’d really love to meet and swim with one day.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Amazing! What about music? Do you listen to a playlist before an event or while preparing?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Not really. When I’m training, my dad is out of the pool giving me instructions. That becomes the soundtrack of my training. In open water, we avoid earphones for safety. Sometimes there’s music playing on the boat, but it’s all about paying attention to the crew and their instructions. Safety comes first.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Makes sense. Now, let’s talk about your social media presence. Was it intentional, or did it just grow organically?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Oh, it happened overnight! I had around 1,200 or 1,300 followers, and suddenly, one video went viral. Boom—40,000 followers overnight! It was surreal. People who knew me were like, “Oh, my god, that’s her!” And people who didn’t know me were like, “That’s not possible.” It was a mix of reactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow! Do you interact with your followers? Do you check DMs?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Yes, I do. Most of my followers are athletes—Olympians, hockey players, football players, swimmers. It’s amazing to connect with them and exchange thoughts.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s the sweetest DM you’ve ever received?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Oh, there are so many! One guy said, “Marry me.” (laughs) I checked his profile, and he’s 22 years old in college. I was like, “Oh, my god.” Another person posted, “That’s my girlfriend,” and I was like, “I don’t even know you!” It’s funny and sweet in its own way.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s adorable! And what about your “pinch me, I can’t believe I made it” moment?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> That’s what happened on social media for me. I didn’t understand what was going on at first. Suddenly, people started recognizing me, and it hit me how important social media is today. But I don’t stress about likes and numbers anymore. For me, it’s about creating awareness—letting people know that open-water swimming exists and emphasizing the importance of safety.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a powerful message. Do you celebrate after reaching a big goal?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Not really. After a swim, I’m literally crawling to find a bed. I need fresh water, a shower, and a place to crash. Recovery takes time, especially after the energy gels and electrolytes. So, celebration can wait—I just need rest.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A quick round of rapid-fire now! Swim with sharks or swim in freezing water?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Freezing water, any day! I can train for it.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you never leave home without?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> House keys and my phone.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite motivational coach or mantra?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> “Just keep swimming.” (laughs)</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Who inspires you the most?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Honestly, I inspire myself. I amaze myself every time.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that! Coffee or green tea before a swim?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Nothing.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Dream collaboration?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> TYR—they make the best swimwear!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Your proudest moment so far?</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> That I’m alive.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sucheta, it’s been absolutely amazing talking to you. You’re such an inspiration.</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika! It was wonderful chatting with you too.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’ll stay in touch and reach out if we need any additional inputs. Keep inspiring and winning. You’re the best!</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> Thank you, Devika. And thanks to your team—Trish and everyone who made this happen.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> (laughs) They’re the real heroes behind the scenes!</p>
            <p><strong>Sucheta:</strong> (laughs) Absolutely. Bye-bye!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye-bye! Take care!</p>
