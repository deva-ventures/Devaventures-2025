              <p>
              Charismatic, grounded, and driven by instinct — Jitesh Bulchandani is not your typical entrepreneur. Founder of Dhandhawithjitesh, a name that already sparks curiosity, Jitesh is someone who stepped into the business world at the age of sixteen and hasn’t looked back since. His journey began not in boardrooms or MBA classrooms, but on dusty construction sites, observing the hustle of real-life “Dhandha” — the street-smart, ground-level world of business. In this candid conversation with Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Jitesh opens up about his early beginnings, family legacy, and the invaluable lessons he learnt outside the pages of textbooks.

              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Jitesh, to the Global Influencers Hub. Here, we explore the inspiring journeys of changemakers and influencers — and we’re really excited to dive into yours. Let’s begin right from the start. Tell us about your childhood, your family, and how the seeds of “Dhandhawithjitesh” were first sown. And I must say — I absolutely love the name!
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh Bulchandani:</strong> Thank you, Devika. It’s great to be here. So, my story starts in a business family — business runs in our blood, you could say. My grandfather was originally from what is now Pakistan, back when it was still undivided India. He was involved in contracts and tender work even back then. That’s where the family journey in business really began.
              </p>
              <p>
                Later, my father carried that forward and took on tenders as well. I joined in when I was just sixteen, working alongside my father at our firm, Ashiana Builders Private Limited. That period was a turning point for us. From there, we never looked back — the grind began early, and it became a way of life.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a fascinating start. But tell me — back then, how did you feel about getting into business? Was it something you were naturally curious about? Or did it feel more like a duty — something you were just expected to do?
              </p>
              <p>
                Because honestly, speaking from my own experience, I was born into an academic family, so business wasn’t something I grew up around. I had to learn it step-by-step, much later. So I’m always curious to know what sparks that interest in someone so young.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> That’s a good question. Honestly, my family always wanted me to focus on my studies, get a good education, and land a secure job. But I wasn’t into studies at all. After a while, my father lost hope that I’d ever sit down with a book!
              </p>
              <p>
                So when I joined him in the business, it wasn’t because I had some grand vision — it was because I wanted to earn money and prove I could do something. At that age, I wasn’t thinking long-term. I just wanted to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                But slowly, I started understanding the real world — the problems, the pressures, the people. That’s when I realised why my father kept insisting on education. The practical lessons were tough. And to be honest, back then, none of my peers were working — everyone said, “Why are you doing this at such a young age?” But for me, it was necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. And I love how you bring in that raw reality. Now, tell us more about your 16-year-old self — how did young Jitesh navigate those early days? What were the challenges like?
              </p>
              <p>
                I’m also working on a project called Youngpreneurs, which is all about nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset in teenagers. So, I’d love to hear more — your story really aligns with that mission.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> Oh, I have plenty of stories from that time! I remember my dad used to ask me to study at home, and I’d flat-out refuse. Then he’d say, “Fine, come with me to the construction site — study there.” So I’d carry my schoolbooks with me, sit in the site office… but instead of reading, I’d be watching the workers and engineers.
              </p>
              <p>
                I became fascinated with how things worked — the planning, the execution, the problem-solving. Slowly, the books took a backseat. It became my daily routine — going to the site, soaking everything in. And because I was a kid, everyone treated me like one — which gave me the freedom to observe without pressure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over time, I grew up in that environment. And today, when I look back, I realise what I did wrong — maybe I should’ve studied more. But honestly, it felt like a natural path. Business is in my blood — my grandfather did it, my father did it, and now I’m here continuing that legacy. You could say it’s genetic too.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So, it sounds like business was not just a duty — it was a kind of legacy, something that naturally pulled you in. But tell me, what was the most fun memory you have from those early days? Was there a particular moment or routine that stands out?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> Oh yes — Saturdays! I used to look forward to Saturdays like anything because that’s when we made payments to the labourers. It became a ritual. I would count the cash and hand it out personally. That feeling — of being part of something real, of giving — it made me really happy. It was non-negotiable for me. No matter what else was happening during the week, Saturdays were sacred.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful — you found joy in something so practical, yet powerful. That act of distributing wages must’ve felt very grounding. So tell me, back then, who was your biggest inspiration? Was it your grandfather or your father?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> Honestly? At that time, I didn’t have any specific inspiration. I wasn’t following anyone or idolising anyone. I just wanted to do something with my life — to do good. That was the core drive.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s interesting. So, when you say you wanted to “do good,” was there a moment when you realised that — when it became clear to you that you wanted your life to have purpose or direction?
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> Yes, I remember observing how my grandfather, my father, and even my elder brother were respected. I’d see people sit with them, talk business, and treat them with such admiration. That respect wasn’t just about money — it was about impact, about reputation. It made me realise that true success is when people value your presence and your principles. I wanted that. That’s when I made up my mind — I want to be a good entrepreneur, someone who makes a real impact on society. Money would come, but goodwill mattered more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I became obsessed with the idea of business. By the time I was 19, I had launched my own startup — an electronics and mobile showroom. It was doing well. Then COVID hit. Around the same time, I was planning to move to Canada, but things changed. My father’s health declined, and I decided to stay. Canada didn’t happen, but I never looked back. I just kept moving forward.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s incredible. I love your spirit — the way you’ve taken everything in stride. It’s really powerful to hear how grounded and clear you were, even as a teenager.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Jitesh:</strong> Thank you. Honestly, I believe in flowing with life. I trust the process. Wherever it takes me, I give my best.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! Now let’s talk about DhandhaWithJitesh. I absolutely love the name, by the way. How did that come to you, and how did this journey begin?
              </p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Honestly, it happened very randomly. I always wanted to have a presence on social media. During the whole “blue tick” era, I’d see people building their identities online, and I craved that. Even though I was an introvert, I had this urge to express myself. When I started making videos, something changed in me. I became more confident. People started recognising me, engaging with me — I loved it.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Earlier, I wanted to do something in gaming, but my parents didn’t support that idea. Then there came a time — around six or seven months — when I had a break between projects. And you know, when you’re someone who works 9 to 9, sitting idle isn’t easy. Around that time, I met a friend who had just finished a gaming session. He told me, “You should be making videos — your confidence, the way you speak — it has power.” I told him, “I’m just doing business,” and he replied, “Exactly! That’s what people want to learn — how to do business.”</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> The next day, “Dhandhawithjitesh” was born. It started slowly — I began sharing basic legal knowledge and business setup tips, especially for people in Tier 3 cities. Many of them don’t know where to begin. I saw people struggling with simple processes and realised there was a gap I could help fill. The response was overwhelming. I’ve been on a short break recently due to two weddings in my family, but the journey has been amazing so far.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. So tell me, when was the first time you actually helped someone set up a business and saw real impact?</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> There have been quite a few, but the first one was back in college. My best friend, Anubhav, used to sell homemade chocolates — his aunt made them. I helped him scale that up a bit. That was the beginning.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Later, when I stepped into professional consulting, I worked with a Kolkata-based fashion brand called Infinity. They produce top-notch clothing, and I supported them during their initial business structuring.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> More recently, I was approached by a young boy — just 17 or 18 — who wanted to enter the trending roasted gram flour business. It’s a growing space in India, and he saw potential in the gap. I saw his vision and passion, so I didn’t charge him. That’s my principle: if someone’s aim is only to make money, I charge my consultancy fee. But if their vision is to build a brand, something long-term, I help them wholeheartedly, without charging. Because people who think long-term are the ones who truly succeed.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely true. And honestly, without being a brand, it’s very hard to sustain yourself these days.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly. Over the years, I’ve worked with several brands — some succeeded, some didn’t. There were even a few betrayals. One was a reputed brand in the gaming industry — I won’t name them — but they ditched the collaboration midway. That’s part of the journey. But you learn and move forward.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> These days, my own relatives and close friends often come to me for business advice — asking what to do with their startups or ideas. It’s funny how your image changes over time.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, I can imagine. So tell me — when was the moment you really felt that helping others was your calling? You were already doing business, you had social media figured out — but when did it truly come from the heart?</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> I think the seed was planted way back — when I was in 5th or 6th grade. My father started a home-based charity initiative. Every Saturday and Sunday, my mother would cook food for 300 to 500 people. Then my father, uncle, and I would go out to distribute the meals — especially to the needy: orphans, people with disabilities, those who were truly struggling.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> We did that for 6–7 years straight. That experience stayed with me. It built a habit of giving without expecting anything in return. So even now, my goal is that if I grow, I want to take others along with me. No one should be left behind.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Beautiful. That’s such a powerful thought.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Thank you. That’s how I think. Whether it’s my team or even my house staff — if they ever need anything, I make sure to support them. I believe everyone should succeed in life. That’s always been my mindset.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> All rise up together, all grow together.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly! That’s my motto — I want everyone around me to be happy and successful in their own way.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. I love that spirit. Now tell me, after all of this, was DhandhaWithJitesh a well-planned move? Like a step-by-step process?</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Not at all. DhandhaWithJitesh wasn’t planned. It just happened randomly. I started creating videos, and they began going viral. That moment when what you’re thinking begins to actually happen — you get excited. At that point, you don’t need too much planning; you go with the flow.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Of course, I did try to plan some things in between, but they didn’t work out as expected. And honestly, I’ve really enjoyed this journey. I’m still enjoying it. Meeting new people, learning new things — none of this was planned, and that’s what makes it so special.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s cool — very cool! Now let’s talk about the challenges. When you started DhandhaWithJitesh and began helping others build their businesses, what were the biggest obstacles?</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> In my understanding, the biggest challenge is funding. We’re 90s kids, right? Our parents understand things differently compared to Gen Z parents. Most of the people who come to me with ideas — the moment they back out, it’s usually because of lack of funds. Without investment, they feel they can’t move forward.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Some even ask me to invest, but I’m already involved in three to four businesses. I have limitations too — I have to take care of my family.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> The second challenge is execution. A lot of people have great ideas and even plans, but they don’t know how to execute them. That’s where many people fail. Only a few individuals are truly able to carry their plans forward step by step.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes! There are so many people who just leave their idea as an idea. Even two years later, they’re still only talking about it.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly. That’s where I try to help — aligning their ideas with real-world execution. And the people I’ve supported — they’re doing well today.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s awesome. So tell me — what’s the best advice you’ve received about business or entrepreneurship?</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> To be honest, no one gave me any advice. I learned it all on my own. One major lesson I’ve learned is: don’t expect your family to help you run your business. People often think, “I have a big family; they’ll support me,” but that’s not the reality. It rarely happens. You might get lucky, but most of the time, it’s the people who truly connect with you who’ll step up.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> And the second thing — especially in India — I’ve noticed that strangers help you more than people you know. That’s something I’ve seen during my travels too — in many countries, support from strangers is stronger.Also, never let money come between friendship. Either maintain a professional boundary or keep the friendship pure — but don’t mix the two. Those two lessons have shaped me a lot.</p>
           
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very cool. Now you’ve interacted with so many aspiring entrepreneurs — tell me, what’s one trend you’ve noticed among them?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Across all the inquiries I’ve received from different states, one trend I noticed is that people are obsessed with weddings! For example, there was a time when customized water bottles — with the couple’s names printed on them — became a massive trend. Everyone wanted to jump into that business.</p>
              <p>But people didn’t recognise the competition. Nowadays, people buy clothes just because there’s a sale. Everyone wants to start something in fashion, but they don’t realise how much money goes into PR, product shoots, marketing — it’s a lot.</p>
              <p>The same happened with cloud kitchens — there was a huge hype initially, but now people have lost interest.</p>
              <p><strong>My suggestion?</strong> Be creative. Don’t just copy what’s trending. Think differently.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that insight. Now tell me — what’s one quality you’ve seen in successful entrepreneurs that really stands out to you?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> The ones who truly build themselves up — the real, successful entrepreneurs — they are down to earth. They’re humble. They don’t let ego get in the way. That’s the quality I admire the most.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very true. Absolutely right.</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> When I was 18, I was extremely egoistic. I had a lot of money, nice cars — I felt on top of the world. But when I started my mobile showroom, I had to put all that ego aside. That’s when I really began doing the work and entered a new phase of life.</p>
              <p>Now, the people around me are all very grounded. I’ve even seen the owner of a large sales group — a man with so much success — being completely down to earth. People like that really inspire you. My father is also like that — he treats everyone equally, whether they’re rich or poor.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s actually so important. Once you let ego take over, you stop learning — and the moment you stop learning, you stop growing. That’s why the most successful entrepreneurs are the most humble.</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly. Even Ratan Tata is known for being extremely humble. He never focused on keeping profits for himself — he donated so much. That’s a huge thing.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So if you had to give advice to your 18-year-old self, what would it be?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> I would say, Please be humble. Be kind. The world needs calmness right now. Most 18-year-olds today are heading in the wrong direction. They think partying or doing drugs is cool. But by the time they realise their worth, they’ve already lost a part of themselves. So I’d say — be kind, be calm, and be grounded.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes! It’s so important to spread that message — it’s cool to be kind. It’s actually uncool to be rude or arrogant. Some people confuse arrogance with confidence, but honestly, it’s not cool at all.</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> People will learn that through life’s lessons. I was one of them. I learned it the hard way — that every action has consequences. But I corrected myself and redirected my path. That’s when real growth started.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Now let’s say we followed you for a day — what does a typical day in the life of “Dhandhawithjitesh” look like?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> These days, I’ve been on a personal transformation journey. I wake up early and work out in the morning. Between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm, I reach the office and stay there till 7:00 pm. After that, it’s me-time. I don’t take calls or check Instagram posts — my team handles that.</p>
              <p>Evenings are for family and friends. We have dinner together. My life is very simple and peaceful.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s really cool. Now tell us about your social media. It’s buzzing — how do you interact with your followers?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> I usually go live every 15–20 days. I try to reply to all the messages. Whenever people tag me in posts, I make sure to share them — it feels great to know that I’m inspiring someone.</p>
              <p>In the early days, I used to get affected by negative comments — especially ones about my health. But now I realise everyone is unique. And honestly, if someone makes fun of me in memes or comments, I join in and laugh with them. I don’t take it personally anymore.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a healthy attitude. Now tell us — do you have a memorable fan moment or follower interaction?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Yes, I do. Once, I was at the hospital because my uncle was admitted. That was when “Dhandhawithjitesh” had just started. A guy who followed me came and sat with me the entire night at the hospital. He was the first person I met because of my content. That moment stayed with me — I really felt like God had sent him. I even noted down the date.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so heartwarming. So what’s next for “Dhandhawithjitesh”?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Right now, we’re working on 2–3 upcoming podcasts. My goal is to do podcasts with real entrepreneurs — big names who’ve built their own businesses. I’ve made up my mind, and I’m preparing for it.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds amazing. Of course, everything good takes time. Infrastructure and ideas take time to grow.</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Absolutely. Right now, I’m building the base. And the base needs to be the strongest part.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Well said. So what’s been your life mantra or personal philosophy so far?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Sabar. (Patience). You will get everything you desire — just have patience.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And finally, what is the biggest lesson you've learned — in business, in life, in everything?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Don’t trust anyone — not your family, not your friends, no one. It’s not their fault. Everyone is living their own life, and that’s okay. If someone wrongs you, and you keep thinking about it, you’ll never find peace. It’s better to let it go than keep talking about it or holding onto the pain.</p>
              <p>I don’t mean you shouldn’t make friends — of course, make friends, talk to people, be on good terms. But don’t trust anyone blindly. Always keep your guard up.</p>

              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Do you trust anyone?</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Are you asking me?</p>
              <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I mean, I do — in a way. My mantra is “innocent until proven guilty.” I assume people are good until they give me a reason not to. But the moment someone shows their true colors, I have no problem cutting them off — even overnight. So, it kind of balances out. That philosophy has worked for me so far.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, now let’s shift gears and jump into a quick rapid-fire round!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Work hard or work smart?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Smart.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Your go-to meal during a hectic workday?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Chicken tikka.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word to describe your journey so far?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Ups and downs.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Profit or passion?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Passion.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Startup or corporate job?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Startup — any day!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Most-used app for work?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> YouTube.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One business tool you cannot live without?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> There’s nothing specific, to be honest.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sneakers or formal shoes for meetings?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Crocs!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Most awkward business pitch you’ve ever heard?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> There was this company that wanted to manage a billing software plus barcode… that was quite something!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One entrepreneur you secretly stalk for inspiration?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> My father.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Define success in one line.</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Happy living.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube — what’s your favorite platform?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Honestly? None.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One hashtag that sums up your life?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> #sabar</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One business step in less than five words?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Try to impress everyone.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> A reel idea you wish you had thought of first?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> My transformation journey — I thought of it, and it’s in progress. It’ll be out soon.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very cool. I know you’ve briefly mentioned your transformation earlier. Would you like to expand on that a little more?</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Actually, yeah. Before COVID, I was doing really well — physically, mentally, everything. I was half the size I am now. But then I fell into depression, and that took me to a completely different place, mentally. Now, my main focus is on myself. I want to get back to the old Jitesh. And I will — I’m determined to make it happen.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course you will. Absolutely! Life is such a beautiful journey, and we all go through different phases. But one thing I always remind myself of is: “This too shall pass.” It’s a powerful truth to hold on to when we’re feeling low.</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly. This phase will pass. That belief really helps.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I truly hope all your dreams come true. It’s been such a pleasure speaking with you, Jitesh. I’ll definitely message you personally — since you're part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, which is something close to my heart. You've done such meaningful work by impacting so many lives — it really means a lot.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’re all rooting for an entrepreneurial India. Nothing would be better than if the next Facebook comes from India, instead of people just dreaming to work at Facebook.</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Exactly!</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We look forward to the day when we’re not just following the Zuckerbergs of the world — we’re creating them. And yes, India already has great minds, but we need more.</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> We already have that potential — just need to keep going.</p>

            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Jitesh, it was lovely talking to you. Wishing you all the best for everything you’re building and dreaming. Thank you so much!</p>
            <p><strong>Jitesh:</strong> Thank you, ma’am.</p>
