              <p>
              She didn’t start loud, but she started strong. From a quiet childhood in a small Kerala village to becoming a TEDx speaker, bestselling author, and founder of ChilliPixel, Sinchu Raju’s journey is all heart and hustle. In this electrifying conversation with Devika Majumder,Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Sinchu opens up about overcoming fear, juggling motherhood with boardroom dreams, and how being laid off became her launchpad. Her story isn’t just about making it big—it’s about making it matter. If you've ever doubted your timing, talent, or trajectory, this one’s for you.

              </p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Hi Sinchu, welcome to Global Influencers Hub! Here, we explore the life journeys of social media changemakers—and we can't wait to dive into yours. And when I say dive, I mean starting right from your childhood. So, tell us—what were you like as a kid?</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika, for inviting me. Talking about childhood—well, I’d say it was quite normal. I was born into a lower-middle-class family in a beautiful, green village in Kerala. Life was simple, but full of quiet observations. I was a calm and silent child, deeply focused on my studies. You know how it was for us '80s and '90s kids—parents constantly emphasized education.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Even though we didn’t have much access to resources in our hometown, I was always curious. I’d watch successful people visit or pass through, and I remember thinking, “Someday, I want to be like them.” That curiosity and hunger to do something different stayed with me—and still does. I’ve always been drawn to people who inspire, who push boundaries. They motivate me to keep evolving.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fantastic. It’s always beautiful when a quiet child finds their way into the spotlight. For someone so calm, it’s amazing to hear how active you were on stage and in extracurriculars.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes! Even though I was silent in class, I came alive on stage—whether it was arts, crafts, or presentations. I loved being involved. It was my way of expressing myself beyond words.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so powerful. You know, getting a quiet kid out of their comfort zone can be tough, but you seemed born to lead. So tell me—who was your biggest cheerleader back then?</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Without a doubt, my parents. They’ve always been my biggest inspiration. They went through so many struggles in life, but they had a very clear vision: Our kids should live a better life than us. And they meant it.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Especially my father and mother—what made them special was the freedom they gave me. In many families, daughters are often restricted. But in my house, it was the opposite. My brother had more rules to follow, and I had the freedom to explore. I could voice my opinions, travel alone, take decisions—and that shaped me.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly empowering. Especially in a society where we’re often tempted to protect our children from every difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. I still remember when I had to get an attestation for my Class 12 admission. My father didn’t come with me. He just gave me the documents and said, Go do it yourself. I cried then, because everyone else had their parents with them. But that day shaped me. It taught me to be independent.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Later, I realized that this was his way of preparing me for life. Whether it’s travelling internationally or handling paperwork at the bank, those early experiences gave me courage. He never shielded me from responsibilities, and I’m grateful for that.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That really is amazing. The inner strength that comes from those little “tough love” moments is something most people don’t understand. But it builds a foundation for life.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely. It’s something I even wrote about in my book. The way my father guided me—he’d show me the direction, but he’d make sure I walked the path myself.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Tell us about a fun childhood memory that still makes you smile every time you think of it.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Oh, it’s less of a smile and more of a laugh! It was the first time I ever cooked something, and it was a total flop. I still remember it so clearly. My brother was starving, and I tried making poha—this Maharashtrian dish—but what I ended up with was... definitely not poha.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So it turned into a completely different dish?</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely! It looked nothing like poha. I think I ended up mixing in some leftover curry instead of using the proper ingredients. I was trying to improvise, but the result was a strange combination of poha and some sort of sabzi. My brother still teases me about it! He always says, “Remember that day my sister cooked me something—we’re still not sure what it was!” It makes me laugh every single time.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. I think we all have those kitchen disaster stories, but the childhood ones are the most memorable.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Definitely. But for me, it’s not just the cooking—it’s the whole feel of village life. I have such vivid memories of rainy evenings, sipping hot coffee with my family. We’d all sit together—especially during monsoon—and my father would share stories from his childhood. Those moments were so warm, so grounding. I feel like today’s generation is missing out on that kind of connection.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Totally. That kind of unplugged family time is rare these days—and so precious.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now let’s talk about ChilliPixel. First of all, I love the name. It’s so fun and quirky! But tell us about the journey. How did you go from being a schoolgirl in Kerala to launching this venture? I know there were some big names like Bentley and Michelin along the way too…</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, absolutely. So, like I mentioned earlier, I’ve always had a passion for doing something new—something of my own. But coming from a middle-class family, “starting a business” wasn’t exactly encouraged. You know how it is—parents think you need lots of money and stability before you even think about starting something. So naturally, I began by looking for jobs after college.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> I graduated around 2009–2010 and started working with digital marketing startups. That’s where I got my first taste of the business world. Working with different companies gave me incredible exposure—how startups build from scratch, what challenges they face, and how brands grow. I also got to work with international clients and even had a stint in Dubai.</p>

<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And Michelin—that was a major chapter, right?</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Oh yes, Michelin was a turning point. It was my first big corporate experience, and I often call it my real university—better than any MBA. I worked on building something from the ground up with them, especially around onboarding dealers and creating digital ecosystems. It taught me two things: how to build a business and how to thrive in the corporate world.</p>

<p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> That combination—startup agility and corporate structure—gave me the foundation I needed. And eventually, all those experiences led to ChilliPixel.</p>
<p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s exactly what I believe, too. Hands-on
                experience at startups teaches you more than any MBA ever could. It
                forces you to wear multiple hats and pushes you out of your comfort
                zone constantly. It’s a whole different ballgame.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely. And you know, for me, that phase
                was a complete twist in my life. Everything happened at once. My
                daughter had just turned one, and I had to shift to Pune—alone—with
                her. My husband was working in a different state, so I had to manage
                everything by myself.
              </p>

              <p>
                And just when I was settling into this new chapter, I lost my father.
                It all happened within a span of three months. At the same time, I was
                also stepping into a new project at work, a new phase altogether. So
                imagine the emotional and mental pressure—it was overwhelming.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That must have been incredibly tough. So much
                coming at you at once...
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> It really was. I reached a point where I felt
                I couldn’t do it anymore. I went to HR and told them I wanted to quit.
                I just couldn’t manage everything. But I still remember—her name, her
                face—she said something to me that changed everything. She told me,
                “If you quit now, maybe you'll escape these challenges temporarily.
                But what if the next company brings new ones? Will you keep running?
                Instead, learn to manage them. That’s what builds real strength.”
              </p>

              <p>
                That hit me hard. I realized she was absolutely right. Life won’t stop
                throwing challenges. What matters is how we handle them.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful perspective. One
                sentence—one human moment—can completely alter your path.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. That conversation changed something
                in me. I stayed on. And not only did I manage, but within a year, I
                received the Best Employee Award and even got promoted. That one piece
                of support pushed me from a breaking point to a breakthrough.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> It’s incredible how deeply those moments stay
                with us. I completely relate. When I lost my mom, I was working in the
                U.S., and it was a really dark time. I was showing up at work, but
                mentally I wasn’t there.
              </p>

              <p>
                My boss—he was the Managing Director of State Street Global
                Advisors—he didn’t say a word for two weeks. He just gave me space. And
                then one day, he sent me an email. No big speech—just a simple line:
                “Devika, I believe you have so much potential. Take your time to
                grieve, but then come back and claim that potential.”
              </p>

              <p>
                It was that one message that pulled me out of the fog. Grief is hard,
                and family helps, yes—but sometimes a gesture like that, especially in
                the professional space, is deeply defining.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, exactly. It’s not always the grand
                gestures—sometimes it’s just the right words at the right time that
                help you reclaim yourself.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> These defining moments truly shape who we
                become. Were there moments of doubt when you were just starting out as
                an entrepreneur?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Oh, definitely. I had been thinking about
                entrepreneurship for years—but in my mind, everything had to be
                “perfect” first. You know, a certain amount of savings, stability, a
                proper plan… then I’d take the leap.
              </p>

              <p>
                But last year, everything changed. I was laid off. And that shook me. A
                lot of people around me—my colleagues especially—knew how active and
                passionate I was about marketing. They said, “Why don’t you start your
                own agency? You’re made for this.” Some even gave me referrals right
                away.
              </p>

              <p>
                But still, I lacked confidence in myself at that point. I wasn’t
                ready—or so I thought.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So it was like the opportunity came
                knocking… but not in the way you had imagined?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. It wasn’t the launch I had dreamt
                of, but it was a launch. I could have gone looking for another job.
                But deep down, I knew this was my moment. The situation wasn’t ideal,
                but it was real. It was now or never. So I said to myself—“Maybe this
                isn’t the way I planned, but this is the way it’s happening.” I grabbed
                the opportunity.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important mindset shift—
                recognizing the opportunity, even when it doesn’t wear the outfit you
                expected.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Right? That was my biggest realization—
                opportunities won’t always come dressed like dreams. You have to adapt,
                recognize them, and move forward. And honestly, the past year has been
                nothing short of an adventure.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you’re in a corporate job—especially in top-tier companies—you’re
                in a relatively secure zone. But as an entrepreneur? You're
                everything—the marketer, the recruiter, the manager, the accountant.
              </p>

              <p>
                One thing that really helped me was the foundation I built while
                working at Michelin. Their structured systems and work culture gave me
                a blueprint. Even now, I follow many of those principles at
                ChilliPixel. Creating systems is what keeps things running smoothly.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. And you're building a culture
                too?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, very consciously. Most of our team works
                remotely, so we’ve created a flexible, trust-based work culture. I
                don’t believe in micromanagement. Give people the space—and they’ll
                give you their best.
              </p>

              <p>
                Of course, it’s not easy. Last year was particularly tough—my brother
                suffered a stroke. That was emotionally very heavy. But again, I leaned
                into the foundation my father gave me—his strength, his calm
                mindset—it helped me get through it. I stayed grounded.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so powerful. We often underestimate how
                much our roots help us in moments like these.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. That’s why I say—entrepreneurship
                isn’t just a job, it’s a mindset. Every day brings new challenges. But
                if you’re clear about your “why,” and you’re willing to learn and
                adapt, you’ll figure out the “how.” And despite the chaos, I’m enjoying
                it. Every bit of it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. That’s the core of an
                entrepreneurial mindset—always looking for solutions, not excuses.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, yes. And that’s what keeps me going.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> You know, as entrepreneurs, we’re wired a
                little differently. We don’t dwell too much on the problems—we focus on
                how to solve them. That’s the real beauty of this path. So tell me,
                what lessons have you carried forward from your corporate journey into
                your current entrepreneurial one?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Definitely the biggest one is systems.
                Building strong systems and sticking to values—these have been
                non-negotiable for me.Whether it’s our internal processes or how we work with clients, I’m very particular that our work should reflect quality over quantity. And that value system must show up in everything we do.
I’ve drawn a lot of this from my time at Michelin. It’s a 200+ year-old company, and the way they nurture employees with strong ethics, structure, and clarity—it had a huge influence on me. Honestly, that experience shaped my mindset deeply. Even today, clients tell me they feel clarity when we speak. That confidence? It came from that corporate foundation.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s exactly what I believe, too. Hands-on
                experience at startups teaches you more than any MBA ever could. It
                forces you to wear multiple hats and pushes you out of your comfort
                zone constantly. It’s a whole different ballgame.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely. And you know, for me, that phase

                Advisors—he didn’t say a word for two weeks. He just gave me space. And
                then one day, he sent me an email. No big speech—just a simple line:
                “Devika, I believe you have so much potential. Take your time to
                grieve, but then come back and claim that potential.”
              </p>

              <p>
                It was that one message that pulled me out of the fog. Grief is hard,
                and family helps, yes—but sometimes a gesture like that, especially in
                the professional space, is deeply defining.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, exactly. It’s not always the grand
                gestures—sometimes it’s just the right words at the right time that
                help you reclaim yourself.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> These defining moments truly shape who we
                become. Were there moments of doubt when you were just starting out as
                an entrepreneur?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Oh, definitely. I had been thinking about
                entrepreneurship for years—but in my mind, everything had to be
                “perfect” first. You know, a certain amount of savings, stability, a
                proper plan… then I’d take the leap.
              </p>

              <p>
                But last year, everything changed. I was laid off. And that shook me. A
                lot of people around me—my colleagues especially—knew how active and
                passionate I was about marketing. They said, “Why don’t you start your
                own agency? You’re made for this.” Some even gave me referrals right
                away.
              </p>

              <p>
                But still, I lacked confidence in myself at that point. I wasn’t
                ready—or so I thought.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> So it was like the opportunity came
                knocking… but not in the way you had imagined?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. It wasn’t the launch I had dreamt
                of, but it was a launch. I could have gone looking for another job.
                But deep down, I knew this was my moment. The situation wasn’t ideal,
                but it was real. It was now or never. So I said to myself—“Maybe this
                isn’t the way I planned, but this is the way it’s happening.” I grabbed
                the opportunity.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an important mindset shift—
                recognizing the opportunity, even when it doesn’t wear the outfit you
                expected.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Right? That was my biggest realization—
                opportunities won’t always come dressed like dreams. You have to adapt,
                recognize them, and move forward. And honestly, the past year has been
                nothing short of an adventure.
              </p>

              <p>
                When you’re in a corporate job—especially in top-tier companies—you’re
                in a relatively secure zone. But as an entrepreneur? You're
                everything—the marketer, the recruiter, the manager, the accountant.
              </p>

              <p>
                One thing that really helped me was the foundation I built while
                working at Michelin. Their structured systems and work culture gave me
                a blueprint. Even now, I follow many of those principles at
                ChilliPixel. Creating systems is what keeps things running smoothly.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. And you're building a culture
                too?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, very consciously. Most of our team works
                remotely, so we’ve created a flexible, trust-based work culture. I
                don’t believe in micromanagement. Give people the space—and they’ll
                give you their best.
              </p>

              <p>
                Of course, it’s not easy. Last year was particularly tough—my brother
                suffered a stroke. That was emotionally very heavy. But again, I leaned
                into the foundation my father gave me—his strength, his calm
                mindset—it helped me get through it. I stayed grounded.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so powerful. We often underestimate how
                much our roots help us in moments like these.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. That’s why I say—entrepreneurship
                isn’t just a job, it’s a mindset. Every day brings new challenges. But
                if you’re clear about your “why,” and you’re willing to learn and
                adapt, you’ll figure out the “how.” And despite the chaos, I’m enjoying
                it. Every bit of it.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. That’s the core of an
                entrepreneurial mindset—always looking for solutions, not excuses.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, yes. And that’s what keeps me going.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Devika:</strong> You know, as entrepreneurs, we’re wired a
                little differently. We don’t dwell too much on the problems—we focus on
                how to solve them. That’s the real beauty of this path. So tell me,
                what lessons have you carried forward from your corporate journey into
                your current entrepreneurial one?
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Definitely the biggest one is systems.
                Building strong systems and sticking to values—these have been
                non-negotiable for me.
              </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly amazing. I love how rooted you are in your values.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now, tell me—what’s been the most fulfilling moment so far in your entrepreneurial journey?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Two things, actually.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> One—I launched my book.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Two—I did my TEDx talk.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> TEDx had been a dream for nearly three years. I’ve always been active on stage since school, but somewhere in college, that confidence cracked. I became overly conscious of what others might think.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> I still remember—there was this one seminar where I completely froze. I knew the content, but I went blank. And I was labeled the “repeat” student. That scar stayed with me.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> So when I finally stood on the TEDx stage, after fourteen years, and told that very story, it felt surreal. I shared how I came full circle, and how that “failure” didn’t define me—it empowered me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wow. That’s beautiful.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s so important to pause and reflect—look how far we’ve come. Platforms like these really help us rewind our journey. And sometimes, you have to give yourself that pat on the back—you’ve earned it.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. That TEDx moment—it was more than just a speech. It was healing, it was closure, it was celebration. A reminder that no matter where you start, you can always choose where you’re going.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. That’s such an empowering takeaway.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now… let’s dive into my favorite part AI and marketing!</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Let’s go!</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, here’s a fun challenge—can you simplify AI in marketing for a 10-year-old?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Okay, let me try.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> So, imagine you have a super-smart robot friend. This friend won’t replace you, but it can help you finish boring or repetitive work much faster and with fewer mistakes.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> That’s what AI in marketing feels like for me.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> It’s like having an extra brain working with you—doing things like research, writing, designing, and data analysis—so you get more time to do the creative or strategic parts you really enjoy.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a really nice way of putting it. Absolutely!</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Especially for people working 9 to 5 jobs—constantly on the move, under pressure—they barely have time to breathe. With AI, some of that heavy lifting is gone.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Even in my agency, ChilliPixel, we use AI tools for a lot of our workflows—right from content creation to campaign analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Back in 2010, I remember how much time it took just to do proper research or make creatives for a marketing campaign. Now?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Much of that can be done in a couple of hours or less. That’s the kind of efficiency AI brings.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s almost unbelievable!</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. And now, I’m also working with AI agents—which are like mini virtual assistants. They can handle repetitive tasks like replying to queries, sorting data, or even running basic reports.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> This frees up time for the team to focus on higher-level thinking or client interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s crazy how far it has come. And, I mean, the possibilities are endless, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely. In the future, even podcast editing could be handled by AI models. You just drop your raw file, and boom—editing, transcripts, titles, everything done automatically.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly! One click, and it’s all ready. It’s wild. I’m still wrapping my head around how far this could go.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> And we’re just getting started.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> This is amazing. Now let’s talk about women in tech and marketing. The journey can be quite different—what has your experience been like?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Honestly, I don’t look at it through the lens of men vs. women. For me, it’s always been about opportunity—and how well we utilize it.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> What I’ve learned through my journey is this: be consistent. Whether you're a man or a woman, that doesn’t matter. If you're consistent, clear about why you're doing what you do, and stay passionate, success will come.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> But most people miss this. Especially when I connect with new entrepreneurs, they’re often looking for instant results. And I always say: “This is not a sprint. It’s a marathon.”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Totally agree with you.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> And that’s why 95% of startups fail—they don’t have patience or a long-term vision. If someone expects a return within a few months, they won’t survive five years in business.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> You need to build. Slowly. Strategically.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> What advice would you give to young women starting out?</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Be patient. Be focused. And most importantly, don’t worry about what others are going to say. You’ll always have people who question your choices—“Why are you doing this?”, “Is this even worth it?”</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Ignore the noise. Keep your head down. Do the work. If you believe in yourself and your goals, results will follow. Eventually.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s gold. I think we really get caught up in who’s going to say what, and we let it stop us.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That reminds me of something I shared in my TEDx talk too—my second point was: “Only take advice from people who’ve walked the talk.”</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s a lesson I live by. Like, when I started my business, I didn’t ask my dad for business advice—because he wasn’t an entrepreneur. He worked a job all his life. And honestly, our parents mean well, but they often discourage us from taking risks.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Instead, I spoke to my uncle—he’s a successful entrepreneur. He’s lived that life. So I knew his advice came from experience, not fear.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> So I think what you said about closing or shutting your ears is really, really important. Because otherwise, your vision gets clouded.</p>
            <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> One person gives an opinion, another person says something different—it just becomes noise. And before you even start implementing, many ideas die under the weight of a million opinions.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. That’s a very solid point.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. Most people I’ve connected with are incredibly talented, but their biggest barrier is worrying about what their parents will say, what their spouse will say, or what society will think.</p>
              <p>That’s why the community is so important. Surround yourself with people who share your mindset and support your passion.</p>
              <p>If you’re doing something just for fun or timepass, that’s fine. But if you’re serious and passionate, 99% of people face this fear of being judged, of what others will say.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, totally.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> That’s why it’s also so important to choose your friends wisely. When you’re down, the right friend will lift you up, not bring you down with doubts like, “I knew you wouldn’t make it.”</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly. That support is crucial. Now, you’ve been named one of the most influential digital marketers. What do you think sets you apart?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> For me, it’s all about consistency. I’m deeply passionate about digital marketing—I’ve been in this field for over 15 years. I’ve worked with startups, MNCs, and now I’m connecting with even more people. When your passion is strong, the right opportunities come to you. That’s always been my belief and how I’ve stayed on this path.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. See, without passion, I don’t think anyone can truly succeed. Success requires consistent effort. It’s something you have to do every single day. And if you have passion, you don’t get bored. That’s the key. Right?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly. You don’t get bored, and that’s what keeps you going. That’s really the why behind what you do.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, exactly.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> About coaching—I’m not doing much formal coaching, actually. I’m mostly focused on consulting and services. But I do coach kids sometimes, to motivate them. I have a community where I was very active initially, but now I’ve limited my time to focus on empowering kids and helping them find direction.</p>
              <p>Most young people don’t really know how to move forward after college—I was there too. So I focus on coaching at that level. My goal is to make an impact.</p>
              <p>There are many experts in the coaching industry now, but for me, it’s about making a real difference for ordinary people. After my TEDx talk, I realized that many people are in situations similar to what I faced.</p>
              <p>The foundation my father gave me is truly invaluable. It kept pushing me forward every day, through all the challenges. And the way we handle those challenges—that’s something not everyone can do.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. That’s so true.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Finding the right path and being an inspiration to others—that’s what drives me.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Very true, Perfect, very good. Now, tell us about your book.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> The book is titled <em>Fear of Being Judged</em>. It’s all about the fear that I caught from childhood. I’ve written six chapters, each based on six different incidents from my life—moments when I was stuck in difficult situations and how I overcame them. These lessons completely changed my life.</p>
              <p>There were various incidents that happened, and I realized this isn’t just my journey—many people go through similar situations. That was the motivation behind writing this book.</p>
              <p>Fear of being judged is normal. People worry about what others will say.</p>
              <p>For me, even as a child, I was very scared of what my neighbours would think, or what if I failed, or didn’t get good grades. But it doesn’t matter. You should be okay with failing, because when you fail, you learn.</p>
              <p><em>What if you fail? What if you fly?</em> That’s the mindset I want to encourage.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True, true, beautiful. I’m definitely going to read your book. I like that you framed it around six life lessons—that makes it relatable and impactful. That’s fantastic. Now, tell us about three things you can’t live without.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Definitely the internet, my laptop, and my phone. When I wake up, the first thing I do is check my laptop because I’m a bit of a workaholic—but not in the negative sense. I’m always learning, so I need my laptop all the time.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. So your laptop—</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, laptop is number one. Then my mobile, of course. Those are my essentials.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Finish this line — Success to me is?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Success to me is what defines me and makes me happy. It’s having the freedom to do what I want to do. That’s what success means.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I like that. That’s simple and true. Because everyone wants that freedom to do what they love. That’s the essence of success.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely, absolutely. So, what’s next? What’s your next venture?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> This year, I’m planning to launch my business in the Middle East. That’s my next project, and I’m currently exploring it.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s exciting! Congratulations!</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Thank you.</p>

              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Fantastic! Now, a little rapid fire.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Sure.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> First thing you do when you wake up?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Meditation. Five to ten minutes of meditation somewhere calm.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to keep the passion going.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> You seem like someone who’s very grounded, so meditation makes perfect sense.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favourite productivity hack?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Listening to deep focus music before I start any critical work. It helps me concentrate better and be more productive.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, nice! I’m definitely going to try that.</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Definitely.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One marketing buzzword you wish would just disappear?</p>
              <p><strong>Sinchu:</strong> Marketing is changing a lot right now, so I can’t really say just one. Maybe AI is replacing a lot of things, but no — I can’t pick just one buzzword.</p>
              <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fair, one thing’s fine. Book that
              changed your life?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> The book that changed my life is{" "}
              <em>See You, Start with Why</em> by Simon Sinek.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Nice! Very, very nice. Your superpower in
              one word?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> I’d say I’m very punctual and dedicated.
              That’s my power. Also, my friends call me the “Iron Woman” because
              I’m strong and handle challenges smoothly whenever they come.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh wonderful! That’s excellent.
              Punctuality is a huge deal, especially in India where it’s not
              very common. If a meeting’s set for 7:00, people usually expect it
              at 8:30!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Exactly, but I’m very strict about
              punctuality. If I commit to something, I make sure I’m on time.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s fabulous — something not seen often
              here. Kudos to you for that. Respecting time like that is truly
              important. I wish more people here would value time that way. In
              the US, it’s very different — even being a minute late to a
              meeting is almost like a crime!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, very punctual. In London too, people
              arrive 4 or 5 minutes early for meetings.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> No, I’ll tell you an incident. When I just
              joined a company, they had these 9:00 AM meetings. The first time
              I went, I think I got there at 9:02. The door was closed. I
              thought maybe no one had come yet, so I opened it—and literally,
              every single person stared at me! It was such an embarrassing
              moment. After that, I made sure I was always there by 8:55. I
              thought, “This is great, this is not happening again!”
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Haha, that’s hilarious! Now, digital detox
              — yes or never?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, I do digital detox.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course, we all do. It’s a good detox to
              have.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Absolutely.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Your happy place is?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> My hometown — Kerala.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh nice! Kerala, right?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, Kerala — specifically Pala.
              Especially during the rainy season in the evening with hot coffee…
              it’s magical.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> They call it God’s own country as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, exactly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> I can’t wait to visit Kerala someday.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> You should!
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> If not digital marketing, then what?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Maybe working in an IT company.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, favorite coach or mentor to live by?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> My father. He’s my all-time mentor and
              inspiration.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. One thing you Google way too
              much?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Mostly about AI — latest updates in AI
              and marketing. I’m always googling that.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, correct, correct. Last thing you do
              before sleeping?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> That’s my prayer time. I do a little
              meditation — both in the morning and in the evening.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Very nice. Founder’s life in one word?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Adventure.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Good, good, good. It really is an
              adventure. Yeah. What’s the most unexpected compliment you’ve
              received?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Unexpected compliment… My daughter
              sometimes gives me compliments. One day, she told me, “Mom, I want
              to be like you.” That really touched me because she’s been with me
              through my journey from a very young age — even when she was just
              one year old, she observed my journey closely.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow, that’s beautiful. How old is she now?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> She’s six years old now.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay, wonderful, excellent. If your life
              had a theme song, what would it be?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Theme song? Hmm, no idea.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> You’re very active on LinkedIn. Any other
              platforms you’re active on?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Facebook and Instagram. Not as much as
              LinkedIn, but I do post there sometimes.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Your main followers are on LinkedIn,
              right?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Yes, yes. I have around four to seven
              thousand followers on Instagram and Facebook as well, but in terms
              of content and activity, I’m very active on LinkedIn.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> LinkedIn, got it. How do you usually
              interact with your followers?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> On Facebook, I have a small community
              where I engage through immediate messages and posts. On LinkedIn,
              it’s mostly regular posts.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Okay. Do you have a fan moment or a
              follower story that really sticks with you?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Not really. I keep my followers and
              community focused on learning and adding value, so I keep it pretty
              private.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, wonderful. Excellent. It’s been so
              nice chatting with you. We’re almost done. Just one fun question—I
              know I know your answer already—would you rather be stuck in a
              room with no Wi-Fi or no coffee?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> No Wi-Fi, definitely. I can manage without
              coffee, but no Wi-Fi is really difficult.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly, exactly. Cool. So, Sinchu, it’s
              been a great talk. If you could say something about us—Global
              Influencers Hub—that would be wonderful.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Thank you, Devika. I’m really grateful you
              invited me. The initiative you’re taking to reach people and share
              insightful information is truly appreciable. Wishing the entire
              team all the best and much success ahead.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you so much, Sinchu. I’m sure we’ll
              connect on LinkedIn as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Sure, sure.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> We’ll keep in touch. Have a wonderful day
              and all the best in life.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Sinchu:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika, once again.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Bye-bye!
