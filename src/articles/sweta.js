          <p className="lead text-center mb-5">
          You know her as Pistachioby Sweta, but behind the graceful Instagram reels, the global fashion weeks, and the sleek satin drapes, is a woman who rebuilt her life from scratch at 35. A woman who didn’t just chase dreams, she stitched them into reality. In this no-filter conversation with Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global Influencers Hub, Sweta Desai takes us through her journey — from a “naughty, nerdy kid” to a boutique boss walking international ramps. Spoiler: It’s not all glam. It’s grit, grace, and a whole lot of guts.

              <p><strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Hi, Sweta. Welcome to Global Influencers Hub.</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta Desai:</strong> Hi! Thank you so much. It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> We’re so excited to dive into your journey — not just the social media side of it, but the real story behind the search results. And when I say we want to know all about you, I mean we’re going back to childhood! So tell us… what was little Sweta like?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Sweta as a child... wow, that feels like ages ago! But if I try to remember, I was really naughty! </p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful! Naughty and nice, I hope?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh yes, definitely nice too. But honestly, I was also very studious. A bit of both, I guess.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a fun mix! Now tell me, who played the biggest role in shaping your early life?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My mom — definitely. She’s always been my foundation. Right or wrong, day or night — she’s stood by me no matter what.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the true essence of a mother, isn’t it?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. But she’s more than just a mother to me — she’s my best friend. I can share anything with her.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. So, after your schooling years, how did your journey unfold? What steps did you take?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Well, I did my schooling at Aroma, and then college from HLCC. Like I said, I was quite studious — I even pursued a diploma in French from Orléans. After that, I completed my post-graduation in finance and analysis — I’ve done my M.Com, and also an MBA.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wow — that's quite an academic portfolio!</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, I was always eager to learn. I also got married early — I was just 20. But that phase didn’t last very long, and after that, I really began focusing on building my career.</p>
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So when did the creative spark — the fashion calling — really strike?</p>
              <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I didn’t work for a long time during my early years. But around the age of 35, I started exploring designing. That was when it all clicked — I realized I wanted to be financially independent, to create something of my own. And my family supported me wholeheartedly.</p>
          
              <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. Now tell us about Pistachio by Sweta! We absolutely love the name, by the way!</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Thank you! But honestly, there’s no big story behind the name — it was a random pick. It just felt right, and it stuck!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, Pistachio by Sweta — where did the name come from? We love it, but is there a story behind it?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? No story. Just… a lot of randomness. It happened all of a sudden.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Do you love pistachios?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I like them, yes. But what I really love is pistachio baklava — that’s one of my absolute favorites!</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> See! That is something! There’s the connection.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Maybe. Actually, when I was searching for a brand name, I came across the word "pistachio" — and I saw a logo somewhere with two cute pistachios. It caught my attention. It just felt right. So I went with it. There’s no deep logic or story behind it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And that’s the beauty of it. Naming a brand — like naming a child — doesn’t always need logic. It just needs to feel like you.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. Although I do get this a lot — people often ask me, “Is this a food brand or a clothing brand?”</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, I can imagine! But that curiosity actually helps, doesn’t it?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It does. It sticks in people’s minds. And now many people know me only as Pistachio by Sweta. They don’t even know my real name — and that feels like such a proud moment.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such an achievement — to create a brand identity so strong that it speaks for itself. But take us back — how did the journey really begin? What were the early challenges?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> The early days were full of struggles. Honestly, every other building now has a clothing brand, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> So, in such a competitive space, making your name stand out is not easy. I had to push through all that noise. I wanted people to know me through my brand — and that’s exactly what happened over time.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That must feel incredibly rewarding.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It does. I started off by participating in exhibitions — in Calcutta, Bombay, Delhi — wherever I could. And let me tell you, those days were hard. For a one-day exhibition, I would leave home at 3 or 4 AM and return the same night at 1 or 2 AM. It was exhausting, but I gave it my all.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s intense. But clearly, the hard work paid off.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, it did. Slowly but surely. And that phase — as hard as it was — shaped who I am today.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Success never comes easy, but when it does come, it makes the journey worth every second.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It’s a lot of work, Sweta. And that’s exactly why we want to dig into the real effort behind the brand. Because from the outside, it might look effortless — but we know it isn’t.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh, absolutely. It takes a lot of hard work and I’d say, more than anything, commitment. But not just consistency, because consistency doesn’t mean just going with the flow. You can’t sit back and say, “It’s going on, it’s fine.” No! That mindset won’t work.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes, you need that fire. That drive to show up every single day.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. You need to stay involved. Keep pushing.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So let’s talk fashion now. How do you see the connection between fashion and personal expression?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I truly believe fashion is all about comfort first. If you’re not comfortable, it’s not fashion for you. It also defines who you are — your personality, your vibe. Even something as simple as a clean white T-shirt and blue jeans can speak volumes. Fashion doesn’t need to be flashy. It’s how you carry it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. It's your first impression before you even speak.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Right! It’s about knowing what suits you. Not just blindly following trends. That self-awareness — of what enhances your natural beauty, your glow — that’s real style. And I’m not talking about body shaming at all. I mean, just be honest with yourself about what brings out your best. It’s not about wearing shorts or full sleeves — it’s about what works for you.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a powerful point — fashion should empower, not restrict.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. And I think today’s trends are also moving toward more simplicity and elegance. Yes, I wear sleeveless and short clothes too — I have no issues with it — but I really feel that full-sleeve, graceful outfits are making a comeback. Elegance is always in trend.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And there’s no replacement for elegance.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> None at all. Simplicity with elegance — that’s my mantra for fashion.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Let’s shift to Instagram now — your feed is so creative and consistent. How did that journey begin?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Very honestly, my entry into Instagram was purely for my brand. Pistachio by Sweta was my baby, and I wanted to grow it. But I quickly realized, it’s not enough to just post about the brand. You have to be seen — be vocal, be social.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yes — people don’t just buy products, they connect with personalities.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly! You can’t just sit in your boutique and go home — you need to interact. That’s how people begin to know you. And that’s how new opportunities come. I started getting approached for lifestyle blogging, for influencing, for collaborations. And I embraced it.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So it's all interconnected, right?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Totally. When you branch out — meet new people, attend events, collaborate — you’re not just growing personally, you’re also expanding your brand visibility. Everything works hand-in-hand. The more you’re out there, the more people know you, and that naturally reflects on your work.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. It’s all about showing up — online and offline.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes. If you stay in one lane, no one will notice. But when you widen your road, everything flows together.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I’m also a professor at GLS — I take fashion lectures there.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful! So you're directly in touch with the new generation — Gen Z. That must give you such insights into their tastes and preferences.</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. Interacting with them constantly helps you understand what they like, how they think. And that influences so much. You can’t stay in one place — you have to move with the times.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So in today’s world, do you think a designer also needs to be a digital influencer?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> 100% yes. I strongly believe they should be. Because right now, digital influence is the fastest way to connect with people. Everyone’s on Instagram. Who’s reading newspapers or magazines anymore? If you want growth in your business, you have to be out there. Period.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Spot on. Now, how do you stay authentic while putting yourself out there on social media?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? Just be yourself. That’s the simplest way. You don’t need to act or pretend. If you pretend to be someone else, you’ll have to carry that burden every day. Why do that? Be who you are — and things fall into place.</p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love that. Now tell us — what are some absolute must-haves in every woman’s wardrobe?</p>
      <p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Grooming. It’s not about expensive outfits — but please be groomed. You can wear jeans and a T-shirt, that’s totally fine — but make sure your hair is neat, your nails are clean. That’s the least you can do for yourself. If you can’t do that, you can’t do anything for anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So true. Self-care speaks louder than labels.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly. Groom yourself. It's basic respect to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Now for aspiring designers — what’s the one skill they really need today?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> They need to be with the generation. Be practical. If Gen Z likes something, try to understand why — don’t dismiss it. If you disagree, that’s okay — but don’t criticize. Bridge the gap. Try to learn from them. That openness makes all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so insightful. Many people go into criticism mode instead of learning.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, and that’s not helpful. I always say — be positive. Don’t criticize — analyze. Ask why. If you’re rigid or stubborn, you won’t grow. Accept the change. Learn from it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s the mindset that leads to real growth. Now, let’s talk about sustainable fashion — what’s your take?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My advice is — don’t be ashamed of reusing your clothes. Please don’t. You don’t need 365 different outfits for 365 days. Mix and match! Wear that black skirt with a pink top one day, and a white shirt the next. Reuse. Restyle. And you’ll look just as elegant — maybe even more.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So simple. So powerful. And finally — your advice to young fashion creators?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly, I feel the younger generation is advising us! And I love it. Some of the ideas they come up with — even we don’t think that way. And I happily accept it. If someone who's 18 comes to me and says, “Ma’am, try this” — I’m like, wow, I didn’t even know this existed!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a refreshing attitude.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Everyone has their own fashion sense. And I’m truly proud of the younger generation — they’re independent, fearless, and so creative. It makes me hopeful for the future of fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> You know, when we were 18, we really didn’t know much about the world.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, absolutely not. So true.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> We were scared of asking simple things — like even telling our dad, “I want to go out.” We’d hesitate, think twice, maybe ask for permission nervously.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Totally relatable. Things were very different.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, completely.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So, on the rare day when you're not designing, influencing, curating, or teaching — what’s a day in Sweta Desai’s life like?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I do absolutely nothing. And I truly mean that. Nothing is also a kind of work for me.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And very necessary! Stillness is a form of therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It really is. Because, you know, my calendar is packed most of the time — from fashion design to lectures, luxury event curation influencing. So when I get that one empty day — I treasure it. That nothingness is peace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And now you’ve also started traveling abroad for fashion?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes! That’s been another exciting chapter. I’ve started attending international events — London Fashion Week, Milan, and Paris Fashion Week. It’s been amazing. But again, when I’m home and doing nothing — that’s my reset button.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that balance — full calendar, but also full awareness of when to pause. Now, tell us — who is your biggest fashion inspiration?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It has to be Sushmita Sen.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, wonderful choice! She’s iconic.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> She truly is. Her poise, elegance, and confidence — she represents inner strength more than just outer fashion. That’s what inspires me. She carries herself with such grace, and she’s always herself. That’s real style.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So tell us — what’s your guilty pleasure outside of work?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Street food. No question.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Love it! Any particular favorite?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Pani puri. But not the homemade kind — it has to be street-style.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! It’s not real pani puri unless it’s slightly unhygienic, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Exactly! If it’s too clean, you’re probably going to fall sick anyway, so it might as well be worth it!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What’s something people would be surprised to know about you?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> That I’m actually quite introverted. I have very strong boundaries. Even though I meet hundreds of people through work, only four or five are in my close circle. That space is sacred to me.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s so interesting, because you're so social by profession.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes, but that's the job. I have to be cordial and warm with everyone — but that doesn’t mean I open up to everyone. I stay guarded, and that’s how I protect my peace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you weren’t a designer today, what would you be?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> A chef or a restaurateur! I love to cook. Name a cuisine — Gujarati, Rajasthani, Punjabi, South Indian, Chinese, Lebanese, Italian — I cook them all.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh my goodness! That’s amazing. So cooking is your hobby?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It’s a hobby, a form of relaxation, a creative outlet — everything rolled into one. For me, cooking is therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I love that. Now, tell us — what’s the one achievement you’re most proud of?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Walking international ramps — Paris, Milan, London Fashion Week — has been a dream come true. For so many young designers, it’s a fantasy. And I’m so grateful to God, and to everyone who supported me, that I could experience it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> What a powerful moment that must have been. And how do you feel Pistachio by Sweta has evolved since you started?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Oh, it’s evolved so much. When strangers walk up to me in a mall or store and say, “Aren’t you Pistachio?”, it’s a surreal feeling. Some people don’t even know my real name — they just know Pistachio. That makes me incredibly proud. I started with a small clothing line, and today, I’ve built a name. That’s my biggest achievement.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> And it’s so well-deserved. You’ve built more than a brand — you’ve built yourself through it.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I feel so happy when people come up to me and say, “Oh, I know you!” It makes all the hard work worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Now tell us — are there any collaborations or dream projects in the works?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Some are in the pipeline. I can’t share too much yet, but yes, there are collaborations I’m analysing right now. Interestingly, I’ve had offers for web series and even movies — but honestly, that’s not my forte. I’m not interested in going that route.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Makes sense — it’s all about staying in your own lane. What’s next for your brand?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I’m working on a new collection for the monsoon. But before that, there’s another major event happening in May, which I need to prepare for. After that, I’ll focus entirely on the upcoming line for Pistachio.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, Sweta — let’s end with a fun rapid-fire. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Ready!</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Coffee or Chai?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Chai.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Heels or Sneakers?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Definitely heels.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I had a feeling you’d say that! Favorite fabric to work with?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Satin.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One celebrity you’d love to dress?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Deepika Padukone.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Monochrome or Brights?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Monochrome.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> City you feel most stylish in?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Milan.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Ah, Milan. Same here — did you shop a lot when you went?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Of course! (laughs) Women and shopping — you know how it is.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Three things always in your bag?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Money, phone, and my perfume.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite color palette?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Burnt orange and black.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word that defines your style?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Elegance.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Alright, what’s your biggest pet peeve in fashion?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Honestly? None. I go with the flow.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Lipstick or eyeliner?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Eyeliner.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favorite fashion era?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> The Twenties — all that glamour and grace.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> One word that describes Pistachio by Sweta?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> My baby.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Aww, that’s so sweet. If you had a message to your younger self, what would it be?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> I wish I had started this earlier. But no regrets — we’re doing it now, and we’re doing it well.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> So well. If your life was a book, what would you title it?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Be Yourself. Be honest. Be honest to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. And so real. Because that’s where authenticity begins.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Yes. If you want to go far, there’s no other way. You can’t take shortcuts. Anyone can copy anyone — but you are you. That’s your power. Why try to be someone else? Own who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Sweta, this has been such a wonderful conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Same here. I truly enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> I wish you a speedy recovery for your foot — we need you at full power for Cannes!</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Thank you so much. I was feeling low today, but this really lifted my spirits.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> That means a lot. Before we end, can you share a few words about our platform — Global Influencer Hub?</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Absolutely. Devika, honestly — I loved talking to you. In just a short time, you helped me revisit my entire journey — from my childhood to now. You and your team are doing such commendable work. It takes courage to support and spotlight people like this. You're helping others grow, and that’s outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Thank you — truly. That means so much.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> It was an absolute pleasure. And I hope we meet very soon — I’m sure we will.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> We will. The universe will make it happen.</p>
<p><strong>Sweta:</strong> Bye, Devika.</p>
<p><strong>Devika:</strong> Bye, Sweta.</p>
