        In this exclusive conversation, Devika Majumder, Co-founder of Global
        Influencer Hub, sits down with Indrani to trace the contours of a life
        shaped by passion, purpose, and an insatiable curiosity. From her early
        beginnings on Blogspot to being recognized as one of India’s most
        respected travel voices, Indrani shares how she navigated motherhood,
        creativity, and a shifting digital landscape—all on her own terms. With
        grace, wit, and warmth, she opens up about the joys and challenges of her
        journey, offering readers an intimate look into a world where travel is
        not just a destination but a deeply personal calling.

      <p>
        <strong>Devika Majumder:</strong> Welcome, Indrani, to the Global
        Influencers Hub. This is where we delve into the inspiring journeys of
        social media influencers from around the world. It’s a space where stories
        come alive—raw, real, and rooted in passion. Today, we’re thrilled to have
        you with us. Let’s dive in! I’d love to start by learning a bit about your
        early life. How did it all begin for you?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani Ghose:</strong> Thank you so much, Devika! It’s a pleasure
        to be here. Well, my journey into travel blogging started back in February
        2007. At that time, Google’s Blogspot was one of the most accessible
        platforms—completely free. One of my close friends, who had noticed how
        frequently I travelled, encouraged me to start writing about my journeys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Back then, I used to take pictures during my trips and share them with
        just a small circle of friends and family. She said, “Why not document
        these experiences? Your stories and photos might resonate with others
        too.” That encouragement planted the seed. I decided to create a space
        where I could not only revisit my own memories but also inspire others who
        love to travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful! So the blog really began as a
        personal archive and then organically grew from there. Now, you mentioned
        that you were traveling quite a bit even before the blog. Was that driven
        by your work, or was it simply a passion?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh, definitely the passion! You know how it is
        with Bengalis—we have wanderlust in our blood. At that time, our children
        were still quite young—around five and nine years old. We felt it was the
        perfect time to travel more actively as a family. They were at an age
        where they could enjoy and adapt to new experiences, and thankfully, they
        were very cooperative.
      </p>

      <p>
        So we started with trips across India, exploring the beauty within our own
        country. Slowly, we expanded our travels to destinations across Europe and
        Asia. It became a shared adventure, something that brought us even closer
        as a family.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds incredible! Traveling with kids can
        be a challenge for many, but it seems like you found a rhythm that worked
        for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, we were lucky in that sense. They enjoyed
        the adventures just as much as we did, which made all the difference. And
        those moments became the foundation for so many of the stories I would
        later share through my blog.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So would you say that travel is your passion—
        something that’s been with you throughout your life?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh, absolutely! I think for me, traveling isn’t
        something that should ever stop. It’s more than just visiting distant
        places—it’s about the experiences, the little discoveries along the way.
        Even something as simple as a trip to the local market can offer a unique
        perspective. You might come across something unexpected—a quirky stall, a
        new flavour, an interesting person—and that in itself becomes a story
        worth sharing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, a journey may seem ordinary on the surface, but it surprises
        you. Those are the moments I love documenting. So yes, travel—big or
        small—has always felt like a lifelong passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a beautiful way to look at it. Seeing
        every journey, even the seemingly small ones, as an opportunity for
        discovery. Now, would you say this passion has become your primary career?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Not exactly. I wouldn’t call it a “career” in
        the conventional sense. It’s more of a personal calling—something that
        brings me genuine joy and contentment. I never set out to make it a
        full-time profession.
      </p>

      <p>
        After I retired from my formal job, I found myself with more time to focus
        on raising my children and taking care of family life. But even with that,
        there was always a bit of time left over—time I could dedicate to
        something meaningful. That’s when everything started falling into place.
        The writing, the photography, the blog—it all became a creative outlet.
        And I’ve just kept going with it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s truly inspiring. It’s refreshing to hear about a passion that grew organically and continues to bring fulfillment without the pressure of labels or expectations.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Exactly! It’s something I do because I love it—not because I have to. That’s what keeps it alive for me.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. Now, let’s talk about the other side of passion—challenges. Have you faced any struggles in managing everything, especially since you’re handling things independently? Do you follow a fixed routine or dedicate specific hours to your blog and projects?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s a great question. Since I work on my own, I’ve never had strict deadlines to follow for the blog itself—it’s always been quite a relaxed process. I enjoy the freedom to create and share at my own pace. But yes, when I take on external projects, especially collaborations or assignments that involve a team, things can get a bit more demanding. That’s when I really have to manage my time more carefully, sometimes rescheduling my personal routine and even asking for a bit of cooperation from my family. Thankfully, they’ve always been supportive. They understand that when “Mom has work,” it means she’s immersed in something she enjoys. In fact, they’re quite happy that I stay creatively engaged—it keeps me out of their head too!</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing! Supportive families make such a difference. Also, I have to say—it’s such a lovely coincidence, but I’m Bengali too!</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh, I know! It’s like an unsaid connection—all Bengalis eventually find each other.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely! So, are you based in Bengal?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Actually, no. I’m Bengali by heritage, but I wasn’t born in Bengal. I was born in Gujarat and later grew up in Shivandrum. My entire education happened there, and I also worked in various places across India before finally settling in Bangalore after marriage. Bangalore has been home ever since.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s quite a journey—so many layers of cultural exposure. Now, shifting gears a bit, I’d love to know more about how you approach storytelling through images. Especially when you're working on a project that involves different personalities, how do you begin shaping a narrative visually?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> There’s no fixed formula, honestly. Every story is unique, and every subject brings something different to the table. If my audience has been following me for a while, they often recognize a kind of continuity in the storytelling—something that connects the dots across posts. When I’m exploring a new destination, I like to give them a sense of what’s coming—teasers, glimpses of the culture, food, and journey. It becomes a layered experience. Over the years, I’ve found a rhythm that works: blending travel with local cuisine, culture, and the personal journey of reaching a place. I wouldn’t call it a formula, but yes, experience has shaped my approach over time.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> It sounds like you’ve developed your own storytelling signature—a blend of spontaneity and structure. That’s what keeps your content so engaging. The experiences really do matter in the end. They shape the stories we tell. Are there any particular emotions you try to capture when you're creating content?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Definitely. One of the things I really enjoy is connecting with locals. That’s always been a big part of my travel experience, especially within India. Since I know a few regional languages, I’m able to engage in meaningful conversations when I visit new places. That’s actually what led me to start the Faces of India series on my blog, way back around 2010. Through that series, I’ve covered around 350 individuals—people I’ve met during my travels. I’d talk to them, learn about their daily lives, their work, their stories. It became something people looked forward to. They’d say, “Okay, Indrani is traveling—who’s the next face she’ll bring to us?” I featured everyone from local artisans to street vendors, tour guides, cooks, and everyday people who are deeply rooted in their communities. Their lives, their culture, and even their struggles became the real soul of the blog.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds absolutely fascinating. Do you still maintain that series on your blog?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, it’s still there. All 350 faces are archived on the blog. At one point, I felt like I had completed a solid chapter with it. A lot of people have asked me, “Why not turn it into a book?”—which, honestly, is tempting. I’ve been thinking about it. It’s just… one of those things that needs the right time.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, I can imagine! But truly, that’s an incredible collection—not just of photographs but of human stories. A book would be such a meaningful extension of that work.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, I do think about it. It’s definitely in the back of my mind. Maybe when the time feels right, I’ll bring it all together in that form.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Good, good—wonderful. Now I’m curious—do you have any personal rituals or habits that help you enter a creative mindset? Something that helps you get into that focused, creative zone?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, definitely. Since a major part of my work involves writing, most of the creativity actually happens after the trip is over. The travel itself may last four to seven days, but the real storytelling begins when I’m back at home—sitting at my desk and writing. So yes, I follow a structured daily routine to keep myself centred. I always begin my mornings with Surya Namaskar—I usually do around 24 rounds. It’s both grounding and energizing. After that, I make sure to go for a walk every day, around 30 to 45 minutes. These rituals are important—they help me clear my head and ease into a calm, focused space where I can write without distractions.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds like your own creative Zen zone—where all the outside noise just fades away.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Exactly. It helps me settle into a rhythm, both mentally and physically. Once I’m in that space, writing becomes much more intuitive.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s lovely. Now, thinking back on your journey, is there a personal project that you’d consider a turning point in your life?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, I’d say the turning point came a few years into my blogging journey. Initially, when I started on Blogspot, it was casual. The blog started gaining traction, and my audience gradually grew. People would regularly return to read my posts and even message me, saying they were looking forward to my next travel story. But the real shift happened in February 2015, when I received my first international blogging assignment. It was in Malaysia, and it came as a complete surprise—I hadn’t even received such an opportunity within India until then. That moment really validated what I was doing. Something that started casually, as a passion project, had grown into something that international tourism boards were beginning to notice. That project made me think—maybe this is something truly worth pursuing. And, thankfully, things unfolded from there. Indian tourism boards also started reaching out. I was fortunate to be selected for several campaigns, and one project led to another. That gradual build-up gave me the confidence to keep going.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing—what began as a creative outlet evolved into something with global recognition. A real testament to staying consistent with what you love.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, exactly. I feel lucky—and grateful—that something I love doing has taken me this far.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So it sounds like that Malaysian project really was a turning point for you—after that, everything just started falling into place.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Absolutely. That one assignment opened a lot of doors. It was as if things just started aligning naturally from there.</p>

          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s wonderful. Now let me flip the question a bit—is there a project that stands out in your mind as something you might have approached differently? Perhaps in hindsight, something that could have been done another way?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Hmm… that’s an interesting one. I think it’s possible, yes—there could be projects that might have benefitted from a different approach. But honestly, for the most part, I followed a fairly consistent pattern in my work. I had a structure that worked for me, and I stuck with it. It wasn't until the audience began asking for more variety—like different formats or newer platforms—that I started to evolve. That wasn’t really a decision I made proactively, but more of a response to what the readers wanted. For instance, shifting into different social media platforms or changing how I presented stories came gradually. There was one fun series I used to run, where I’d post an interesting photo and ask my readers to come up with captions. I’d feature the best ones in a blog post. That was very interactive and fun, but over time, I noticed the interest started to dwindle. So eventually, I let that series go. In a way, the evolution of my work has always been shaped by how engaged the audience is.So to answer your question—no, I don’t think there’s a particular project I regret or wish I’d done differently. It’s more like a natural progression. Some things stayed, some things faded out, and that’s just part of the journey.</p>
          <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> That makes so much sense—there’s a kind of organic flow to the way your work has developed. It’s great that you’re so into your audience. Speaking of which, what’s one thing, or maybe a couple of things, that you hope your audience takes away when they experience your work?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s a good question. These days, with so much information readily available at our fingertips, it’s hard to say exactly what people are looking for. But what I hope is that whatever I share—be it a destination, a cultural insight, a local face, or a food story—offers a sense of authenticity.
        Even if it doesn’t deeply impact someone, I hope it connects with them in a small but meaningful way. I’ve always felt that if something is created with sincerity, it reaches the right people. And based on the feedback I’ve received over the years, I do believe my work has been received—if not overwhelmingly, then at least moderately well. That’s enough for me to keep going.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So would you say there’s a set pattern you follow when creating content? Or is it more fluid?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Well, yes and no. There is a general structure I follow when I’m covering a new travel destination. Typically, I start by documenting the places I visited and what stood out to me—what felt unique. Of course, many people might visit the same location, but the experience is always personal.
        That’s something I believe strongly in—every story is a kind of personal discovery. You might visit the same place I did, but you’ll see it through your own lens, just like I saw it through mine. And that’s what I try to highlight: my discovery, my experience. That’s what gives my work its voice.
        So yes, while there is a loose pattern, every post is ultimately shaped by how I connected with the place, what I felt, and what I want to share from that journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> No, no—you’re definitely answering the question. That really makes sense. Now, shifting gears a bit, what advice would you give to young photographers or bloggers who are just starting out on a similar path?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s a wonderful question. First of all, if photography is your passion, you need to be clear about what kind of photography you want to pursue. These days, the field is vast—there’s architectural photography, bird photography, food, travel, street… so many niches.
        If you’re interested in bird photography, for example, you really have to become an early riser. That’s non-negotiable—birds are most active in the early morning hours. Similarly, if architecture is your thing, then you need to understand at least the basics of architectural styles, design elements, and the history behind structures. You need some knowledge to really do justice to your subjects.
        And if you’re a food photographer, perspective is everything. The way you look at a dish, the angle, the lighting—all of it matters. Someone else may photograph the same plate of food, but if you bring a unique perspective to it, that’s what will make your work stand out.
        So my advice would be—understand your niche, build your knowledge, and never stop experimenting. Let your passion drive you, but make sure to back it up with skill and intent.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Devika:</strong> So, in a nutshell—do your homework well, right?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, exactly.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right. And then maybe, think of how you can bring in a fresh, personal touch—something different that could really resonate with your audience.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Absolutely. I always try to think in terms of, “What can I present that’s a little different? Something that reflects how I felt in that moment.” Sometimes, it’s that small detail or emotion that connects deeply and captures attention.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Right. Because at the end of the day, the audience is everything. Without them, we’re kind of on a solo journey, right?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s true. You can create for yourself, but when there’s an audience that engages, appreciates, and looks forward to your content, it adds a different kind of motivation. You're not just creating in a vacuum anymore.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Exactly. Speaking of audience and reach, you're a Google Local Guide too. What’s been your most memorable review, and did anything unexpected happen afterward?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Ah, yes. I remember during my trip to Cambodia, I captured a lot of beautiful images—especially of Buddhist monks and the ancient ruins. I uploaded some of those photos on Google Maps, and that review really stood out. I’m not sure if it was that specific post that did it, but not long after, I received recognition from Google as a top Local Guide. I always associate that milestone with my Cambodia trip—it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s beautiful. So Cambodia was sort of a turning point again. And now that you're among India’s most sought-after bloggers—what’s been the most unexpected part of that journey?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Well, with recognition comes expectation. People assume that whatever I do will be of top-notch quality. So, yes, there’s a bit of pressure to always deliver your best. Also, these rankings—as a top blogger—don’t stay constant. It’s almost like the stock market! One day, you’re at the top; the next day, you could be down.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a very honest analogy!</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes! It really is. You have to keep putting in effort. And let me say, there are so many excellent bloggers around today. I may have started early, which gave me an edge initially, but the younger generation is bringing in such fresh perspectives and energy. Honestly, I’ve learned a lot from them too.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course! The learning never stops. So now that you’ve had this journey as a blogger, a traveller, and a storyteller—would you say there are any perks that come along with this recognition?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh yes! Although not all perks are monetary, some collaborations come in where people request link insertions or content collaborations. But most of the time, it’s been more of a barter system.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Barter system?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes. In about 70 to 80 percent of the projects I’ve done, the travel, the stay, food—everything has been taken care of. In return, you cover the destination or experience through your blog and social media. So yes, that’s a wonderful perk.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, absolutely. That sounds like a dream gig for any travel enthusiast! Now, is there a particular trip that kindled your love for travel? Or was this just always there?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Honestly, I think it was always there. I’ve always enjoyed traveling. Even if I hadn’t gotten into blogging, I know I would’ve continued traveling—maybe in a different way. But when I wasn’t working full-time anymore and had some time on my hands, I found a way to blend my love for writing with travel. It was a natural fit.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> So it’s more like travel has always been an integral part of your life?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, exactly. It’s just something that was always within me.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> And with all this experience, if I were to ask you, what’s one hidden gem in India you believe more people should know about, what would it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> I’d say the Northeast. I haven’t explored much of it myself yet, but from what I’ve seen and heard, it’s still one of the least explored and appreciated regions in India. The culture, the landscapes—it’s all so rich and beautiful.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Totally agree. Have you been to Shillong?</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes! I went there on a short work trip and managed to cover a bit of the city. It’s truly a gem. Especially now that it’s becoming known for its cherry blossom season—the roads lined with those pink blooms during spring are just magical. That phenomenon has developed quite a bit in the last 7–8 years.</p>
            <p><strong>Devika:</strong> I’ve heard it’s also a lovely place during Christmas.</p>
            <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, it is! The spirit of the season is so vibrant there. It’s very special.</p>
            <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> And finally, from all your travels, what’s one thing you believe every traveller must do—something essential?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> I believe every traveller should make it a point to interact with the locals. That’s when you truly start to understand a place—its rhythm, its culture, its soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> So true. That human connection is what turns a trip into a story. Now, is there a common misconception about travel bloggers that you'd like to clear up?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh yes—definitely! A major one is people assume that if someone is traveling a lot, it means they're just having fun all the time. That it's all glamorous and effortless.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> That's so true. People don’t realize how much actually goes into it, right? The planning, the coordination, the research, the writing...
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> Exactly. There's so much behind-the-scenes work—talking to people, collecting stories, clicking the right kind of photos, figuring out how to share that experience in a way that connects. It’s not just a holiday. It's work, even if it's enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. Now, speaking of things that don't go according to plan, was there ever a travel mishap? Something unexpected or wild that happened?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh, quite a few actually! One of the bigger ones I still remember we were in Lisbon, and my husband got pickpocketed. They took everything: credit cards, IDs. Thankfully, the passports were in a separate bag, so we didn’t lose those.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Oh no! That must’ve been so stressful.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> It really was. And another time, in Seville, we got lost trying to find our hotel. We reached the city around midnight—12:30 or 1 AM. The kids were small, fast asleep in the car, and we were just going in circles. Couldn’t find the hotel at all. Then, out of nowhere, two local women appeared. They had a map app on their phone and helped us navigate to the hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> Wow. That sounds like it came right out of a movie.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> It felt like that! And then again, in Spain—this is more of a funny mishap—I asked a waiter for salt and pepper. He returned with a full plate of chili-fried peppers and salt. They cost me €5!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Devika:</strong> No way! That must have been a language mix-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Indrani:</strong> Completely. I just wanted a pinch of salt, and he brought me a dish! I remember thinking—I could’ve bought an entire packet of salt with that money. Next time, I’ll just adjust to bland food!
          </p>
            
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Now, if you had to pick just one, what would it be? Incredible food, amazing views, or rich culture?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Rich culture—without a doubt. That’s what connects me most to the essence of a place. Culture is something that has evolved over years, shaped by people, their traditions, their festivals, the handicrafts they make, the stories they tell. It’s alive with history.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> There’s depth in it. A story behind everything.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, exactly. Amazing views and great food are, of course, wonderful—but you’ll find beautiful sights and delicious meals in many places. Culture, however, is unique. If a community has preserved it for so long, I feel a sense of responsibility to document and share it—to contribute in some way to keeping it alive.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That's such a beautiful perspective. So much of your work does reflect that intention. Now, switching gears a bit—what’s that one essential item you always pack, no matter where you're headed?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Water bottle! That’s always in the backpack. I don’t go anywhere without it.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Of course. Now, any go-to hacks for finding the best local food or hidden gems while traveling? You know how we’re always trying to figure out where the real good stuff is—do you have a method?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yeah, definitely. So, usually, when I land in a new place—say, when I visited Greece—I had done some prior research, marked down a few places, but still felt a bit unsure about which restaurants to try. What really helped was just asking the hotel staff. I’d ask them, “What’s your favourite place to eat nearby?” Not the tourist spots, but their own favourites. That always leads you to a more authentic experience.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a great tip—more personal than scrolling through reviews online.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Exactly! And I always think—if it’s a place they go to themselves, then it’s definitely worth checking out. If they’ve survived eating there, I will too!</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> True! Okay—next up, what’s on your travel bucket list? Any dream destination coming up?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Nothing concrete planned just yet—this year’s already flying by. But the lookout is always there, whether it's a new country or a new city. Lately, though, I’ve started exploring something slightly different—video editing. I’m sharpening my skills there. Pictures have always been my strength, but now I want to tell stories with video too.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> That’s super exciting! Always evolving. Now if you had to live in a city for a whole year, is there one that calls to you?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes, absolutely—Athens, Greece. I would love to stay there for a year.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Oh, beautiful choice.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> It’s full of layers and layers of history. There’s so much to see and absorb. We were there for four days, and I still felt like it wasn’t enough. I keep thinking—I wish I could revisit and just stay longer...</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Yeah, true. Now how do you hope to inspire your followers through your travel journey? Is there a particular feeling you want to evoke or a message you hope they take with them?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s a good question. I’m not always sure how much I inspire people, honestly. But I do feel that when I visit new places—like my recent trip to Japan—that maybe people find something helpful or inspiring in what I share. I’ve been vlogging a lot about that trip. So let’s say someone’s planning a trip but can only go for five days, while I went for eighteen. I try to curate my experience—rank the highlights, list the top spots—and that way, maybe it helps them plan their own journey more efficiently. They might think, Okay, out of everything she shared, I’ll choose these three places and really make the most of my trip. If what I post helps someone feel more confident about their own travel or discover a place they hadn’t considered before, then yes—I’d be happy to know it inspired them in that way.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Wonderful. That’s such a practical and thoughtful approach—guiding through experience. Okay, some quick rapid-fire for you! Beach or mountains?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Mountains.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Solo travel or group adventures?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Group—with family, basically.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Dream destination you haven’t been to yet?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> New Zealand—for the road trips there.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favourite Indian street food?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Phuchka!</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Most photogenic place you’ve visited?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Meteora, Greece. The monasteries in the mountains, the clouds rolling in—it was surreal.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One phrase or word you learned in another language that stuck with you?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Hola! From Spanish. And yes, also from Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara!</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Favourite travel book or movie?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Book—Chai, Chai by Bishwanath Ghosh. Such a simple yet brilliant idea. He connects everyday railway stations with travel, using something as commonplace as chai—it really inspired me.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Window seat or aisle seat?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Window!</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One place you'd go back to in a heartbeat?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Athens.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Instagram or blog?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Everyone loves Instagram—but I love my blog.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One thing you collect from every place you visit?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Something that reflects the local culture—like a rooster from Portugal or clogs from Amsterdam. It could be a fridge magnet, a postcard, or the actual object. I just make sure it’s small and travel-friendly.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Best time of year to travel—summer or winter?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> I’d actually say spring or autumn! Autumn especially—it’s less expensive and less crowded.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Night markets or early morning sightseeing?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Early morning sightseeing, for sure.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> One song that’s always on your travel playlist?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> I don’t really have one particular song, but I often listen to old Bollywood songs while traveling.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Is there a current travel trend you think is overrated?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Not really. I think it depends a lot on the tourists—if the place is well maintained or not. I wouldn’t categorize any trend as overrated just like that.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Who’s the most inspiring person you’ve met through your travels?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> When I visited Madhya Pradesh, I had the incredible opportunity to meet Padma Shri awardee KK Mohammed sir, the archaeologist behind the revival of many historic sites, including the Patishak Temple Complex. The passion with which he shared the history and the dedication he showed in bringing it back to life—it left a deep impression on me.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> If you weren’t a travel blogger, what would you be doing?</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> Honestly, it’s confusing. I trained as an engineer, then served in the Indian Air Force. After that, I found blogging. Maybe teaching? That seems like something I might have done.</p>
          <p><strong>Devika:</strong> Describe your life’s journey in three words.</p>
          <p><strong>Indrani:</strong> I’m grateful. Always.</p>
          <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Finish this sentence: Travel has taught me
              to…?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Share. I share my experiences, my photographs,
              and the stories I gather along the way. Sharing is what my blog was
              born out of—it’s how I hope to help others on their own journeys.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> What’s one essential skill for travel bloggers
              that often goes overlooked?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Video editing. We all shoot videos now, but
              just uploading raw clips isn’t enough. To truly connect with people,
              you need to create emotion, story, and excitement in your content. The
              attention span is short today, and well-edited videos can make all the
              difference.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> And finally, if you could give your younger self
              one piece of advice, what would it be?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Take more photos. There were so many places I
              visited where I was lost in the moment—which is beautiful, but now I
              wish I had more pictures to look back on. Like Venice, seeing how time
              has changed a place, I often think—if only I had captured more then.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> As a blogger, what’s your approach to maintaining
              an authentic online presence?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> That’s a very important question. You know,
              earlier, there was a trend where people preferred travel photos without
              anyone in the frame. But that’s changed. Now, people want to see you in
              the picture—it adds authenticity. It tells your audience, “Yes, I was
              really there.”
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s become harder to differentiate between what’s real and what’s
              staged because so much is copied or recreated now. Personally, I’ve
              realized that even if you're the one behind the camera, it’s important
              to include yourself—even briefly. For example, if I’m making a
              five-minute video, I try to ensure at least thirty seconds include me
              on-site. It validates the experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, I’ve missed out on that in many of my past trips. Since
              I’m always behind the lens, I often end up with no photos of myself at
              all! Later, I look back and think, “Wait, where am I in these memories?”
              I really wish someone had advised me about that earlier.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s such a valuable insight, especially for
              new bloggers. Now tell me—how do you usually unwind after a busy day?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Oh, if I’m back home after a long day of
              travel, I love to unwind with a warm bath. Then I go through the
              pictures I clicked that day—maybe organize them, take a few notes.
              That’s when my memory is still fresh, so I try to capture the essence of
              the experience while it’s vivid. If I delay it by even a week, the
              details start to fade.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Absolutely. capturing the moment while it’s
              fresh is so important. Besides travel, do you have any other hobbies or
              creative outlets?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes—bird watching! I live in a very green
              neighbourhood with a lot of trees, so I often spot beautiful birds.
              During the COVID lockdown, I really got into bird-watching from my
              balcony. I didn’t start a vlog, but I shared a lot of those pictures on
              Instagram. My feed was full of bird shots during that time.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That sounds lovely. Is there a favourite
              podcast or influencer that inspires you professionally?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Lately, I’ve been really focused on improving
              my video editing skills. I follow Kartikin, who runs "Picture in Pixel."
              I love the way he edits photos and videos—his storytelling through
              visuals is very inspiring to me.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s a great resource! So, is there a personal
              goal you’re working on this year?
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Yes! I’ve already published one book this year,
              and I’m working toward publishing another within the next six months.
              It's based on my travels—stories collected from different countries.
              I’ve slowed down a bit during November and December, but that’s the
              target.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> That’s amazing. Congratulations on your book!
              We’d love to highlight it when the interview goes live.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Thank you so much! The book is a collection of
              stories inspired by different countries I’ve visited. I’ve tried to
              weave those experiences into something meaningful. I’ll share a
              screenshot of the book cover—you could use it in the reels, maybe?
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Devika:</strong> Definitely! Thank you again, Indrani—it’s been
              such a pleasure chatting with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Indrani:</strong> Honestly, I feel so honoured to be here. Thank
              you for considering me worthy of this platform. I truly hope your
              channel grows and features even more inspiring voices in the future. My
              heartfelt best wishes!
